You know that what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like a farmer, or with <unk> and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is usually something that fell somewhere in the place.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I went to her every week in the toilet and the kids saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing her to go into the room of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never get to know us.
You could get it to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I must tell you that I've got pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to engage with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we took <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the take care of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult arrived at <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that <unk> that I told you was actually made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of your life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm really happy that it was really excited about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And this is our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> my <unk> of almost 60 feet, and I couldn't think about it about a <unk> on a <unk> on a <unk> of snow after year.
<unk> are born when you get out of the glaciers or they break the barriers of ice.
Every iceberg has its individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to give up to <unk> to the end, while others can't get it more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> who are isolated separated and themselves, as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts, I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As an iceberg releases the iceberg releases fresh water into minerals which feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique times there are just that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed on Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get to actually witness a B15 iceberg actually.
Here you go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and the line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing up there.
This is a tenth of average size.
<unk> water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so you know, the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about understanding itself, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joins the X chromosome from the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome joins the X chromosome from the X chromosome.
Both <unk> and start life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity on my activity to be two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a trained training and what I study in this case is the way people bring up the anatomy -- the way people came up with anatomy -- that of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role as performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or, like I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with identical twins two people within one body.
I've been working with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose communication typology doesn't fit into male schemes and conventional feminine <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> adopted many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that doesn't fall into the common or the common or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> of the chromosome and tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that they become <unk>
And then, in <unk> testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high testosterone levels but <unk>
As a result, the body develops in a second female course.
When you get the baby out of the baby.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast difference, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is going on.
And then they realized that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body -- something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know its <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who have the Yentl syndrome.
That's why sex is complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> he had a call from a 19-year-old and raised as a <unk> had a life as a boy and I had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
I had an extreme shape of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the 20th chromosomes and the <unk> <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a reasonable male environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormonal component typically a male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at age 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes, they develop what's known as <unk> which is to say, they have broken tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why it happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- that are <unk> identical <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they are being tested for several surgeries that are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that one particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity, <unk> <unk> means having African anatomy in the historical terms.
An incredibly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very divergent ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born as two people in a same body.
The most high case is about the past year with the South African <unk> South African <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you test to do to determine whether or <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or <unk> and women and <unk> we are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we need to admit that these categories -- we thought these were <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- they are much more <unk> than they could.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out to be much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
So as we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved on, in science, we get more and more in an awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to fix a moment from which a body becomes human and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is killed.
Our ancestors never had to come up with this question of whether someone was dead.
As long as they put up with a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved you not to get it yet.
If I stopped moving it down.
But today, we can, for example, to extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of determine really death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this categories of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I am progressive, to make people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
<unk> from the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find every single watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everyone remember, what our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know about DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that it was going to be the political power for the blood of blood from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences, that was really radical.
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were getting two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> transmitted by the way it goes from a vague birth idea.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of coincidence that are <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement came with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
Again, a lot of the color people who are <unk> the <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves, why do we keep ourselves certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we had to <unk> to anatomy.
I don't want to say that at age kids are supposed to be allowed to have sex or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both of them in the middle of America exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary. three months before time, June 1 in June 1980.
So Henry, at the contrary, was born in term, was born on March 1 on 1980.
For the only fact that we had been born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right -- the right -- the right is the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
And virtue of being considered to be considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered to be considered by the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary. For his part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage as Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science advanced in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy of it.
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to get married, and to marry a woman you have to have Y.
Now in practice they don't test tests for people.
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you at the beginning of the Yentl syndrome to the <unk>
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his "I "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this to <unk> rights to people, because I would admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent <unk> smart decisions about their sexual relationships that people from 40 that I know.
So how do we put the theme of <unk> content.
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to lead this current design current to the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense for democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live for example, in a context like the Iranian when a man who feels attracted to other men is really susceptible to being killed, unless it's willing to be prepared to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made birth to give birth twins and then pick them out of their fame.
But when the phone asked her the operation of the operation was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the Indian asylum.
America offers huge possibilities to people to be who are <unk> to change the way the state.
So I think we need to be the head.
Well, to finish out, I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be like democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I mean something a little bit radical for a feminist, which is that I think there can be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've been interested in looking at sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and working in the world.
And what we know about the <unk> studies is that women on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and take care of those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in Feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what does the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I think there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something -- on average, something different between the female and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very attentive to find the way we protect people from the state, it's possible that, if we had made more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect family, let's think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where to go live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their cost of construction.
So easily we could move into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just lined up from apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in your apartment -- they would be owners and the other half is not guaranteed to do it.
You might try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid <unk> and the distractions in the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, build a whole building building, so always and when the rules of that place will be <unk> instead of building <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to <unk> new reform zones to hold cities and give them a name: cities.
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75 dollars will come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next election of the next election -- <unk> <unk> became a platform with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time.
She asked her to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say you can't go and engage all the current residents of apartments.
It will be a lot of attention to the new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like <unk> <unk> and usually the rules that keep us going.
In the fall of 2010, a Guatemala friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a bond with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They call me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain to you about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> terrain that, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms, which is a place where you start with <unk> terrain is a place where you start with <unk> terrain -- the <unk> rules that <unk> there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and three of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city -- you have to start with a place that would go down at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, <unk> <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option in a city that you might be able to go into <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And we also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from developing countries, they could benefit from the countries that help them establish and make the <unk> norms so that they could all trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could easily match a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, 19 from January voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow you to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis in the vote in the Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> it's got to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed over again in another voting on another voting on the other.
Immediately after the voting on the 21st of February, an shifting of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that's building in Korea, is bigger than the Boston center in Boston.
Everything you see there was four years later, after four years old, getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the administrators to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing their Supreme Court to allow us to be the ultimate court for this new <unk>
There's urban planners and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing that we know that they have solved is they have a good number of people.
There are many companies who wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to get to get a job -- sometimes they are <unk> mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents that haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building in a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all around the world?
What do you think about insist that families can choose between many cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is in the inside, I'm going to make a <unk> right, and that is that I live with the <unk>
I love to find, wearing and more recently, to photograph and publish in my blog <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is two hand of <unk> markets for <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to know people -- usually my money is going to a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it into my personal quest for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my <unk>
I will like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, so I feel that I've won.
To go back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I was going on.
I've brought seven pairs of laundry and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly one week is all I put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else I want to use after I got to Palm <unk>
And because you don't know me like the woman walking around in <unk>   That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets of sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that <unk> or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can hardly always see you for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive I ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is power.
It's almost impossible to be impossible for bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get away from the right people, not just <unk> you also <unk>
<unk> <unk> from the child that you carry in.
Sometimes people tell me that I have to play the <unk> or I remind you of their little seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> Trust is key.
If you think you're good at something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you're not good at something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood the meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there is no look you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for no one in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> are going with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and again when people came up to me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all this isn't going to go into my little <unk>
So before I left home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave the back of certain things.
I don't need any emotionally emotionally of these things, because at the end of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, colorful and bright <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody that is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain on this scale?
Some of them <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a big <unk> on both of them -- at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that as most of the other quantum quantum physical physicists, we need quite logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We can play with them, and then we see how react. And then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you may have developed over the years is the one that says one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you were not born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember watching a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid, and I didn't do it very well, they were always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar of parking was taught a precious lesson, and that is that the big things will not allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have from the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with bars, and they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover they do all kinds of weird things -- as they can walk through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics theory.
At that point when the physics was a few years old, you need from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That wasn't really good to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But I didn't get good enough to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't have been.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What you see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green spot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to extend it a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then we make a good good approach to the small metal <unk>
And what you see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard and that <unk> up on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this little <unk> to do this <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum field, but for it it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up to get out of doing those things, because I don't want it to bother you, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The journey of the journey of inanimate objects are not just people, it's the light that <unk> and the wind that happens to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal piece to behave on quantum mechanics, we'd have to squeeze all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We put the lights and then we introduced a <unk> and pulled all the air, and then put it into an temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was <unk> and the way that <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft mode, we were able to make it <unk> and that they didn't do at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make that piece of metal that make that piece of metal -- and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just at certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It's a clean room in a clean room to do this for all those years. Because look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that metal piece is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you think about it?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that I talk about.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do your consciousness act if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it out, and we turned the lights and we looked into the box, and we saw that metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all of the objects on the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just going to break into a little space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that truth.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing a little job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months old.
And many different negotiations and stories, they would be presented with 17 very interesting museums.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining just in this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I was afraid of a great education -- not <unk> but I had no access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going back to school, I began to learn a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
I'd better show you a demo to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, <unk> are we going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the <unk> gallery at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorite one, the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and they <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and, with one click click on it.
They want to go at the end of the hall,
We're still still going forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk>
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on this right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see funny things that are happening.
I love this kid, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to go through it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems to be <unk>
I found that kids were actually playing something.
So a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into depth and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move out the image, so you'll actually see what it is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is to come to come for a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is "the <unk> night -- I think I'd never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all of you, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you that way.
You can online to create their own museum, create their own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, you go in, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of <unk> we just made a quarter around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, you send your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at looking at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even comes from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital means justice to its artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is: "You know, you did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of this is a <unk> a pixel.
We call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am definitely Italian -- all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that there's something very interesting about <unk> careers one in the last two decades.
For some time, if you wanted to win a career from <unk> 1, I would take a budget and put it into a good car, and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what in engineering -- it will be <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that today's control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics and electronics.
They're going to be <unk>
And as <unk> they're starting to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for <unk> during the end of the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all the existing atoms -- they get sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> it says that at the end, he took the hammer -- and he threw it up to the Moses -- -- -- you know, you can actually see a little dent in the <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> What didn't you get?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end of the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity on the Web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the play.
The time line is at the top.
At the afternoon there are people over here and doing <unk>
It starts out the <unk> silence.
I was <unk> from France.
<unk> people make a fast call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time <unk>
First <unk> <unk>
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, I know!
That night everybody went to <unk> to the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everybody went to the center of the winner and the prime minister then.
And then all the world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but about things that we use and consume it.
So today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed a few small tags to track the trash in their shift in their shift in the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all going to be.
Then we put a little chip, and we put it up to the trash and then we start <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that before not exist.
They're going on complicated things, and there's plenty of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we had not yet is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we had a day still still still still still still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked to the beginning, which is rush to the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and you give you valves of <unk> <unk> which is open and <unk>
It was believed as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels you can write in them, I'll show you patterns texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the Mayor <unk>
I liked it very much.
And <unk> a commission to design the <unk> <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no door and windows -- but when you come up with it opens up so you can go through.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the roof.
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears as in this case.
And those days will always be someone in the winter, when the roof, and someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you have it, but when you go down almost all the architecture <unk>
Here it is running.
You see the people that are going into the inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to <unk> the sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way that we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to you to leave you up, but a building that kept making cuts and holes in the water and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> noise) And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of use people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to <unk> that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like we saw earlier, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this <unk>
sort of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, what it changes is the light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different type.
Imagine the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get closer and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, this is what we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an entrance that comes from people, the movement, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world's best dancers today, the star of the New York City star and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left, you see the capture in different <unk>
It's so digitization in real time as a movement.
You can get all the movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment to do something and change our <unk> environment, like the <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world of the <unk> of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this might want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with <unk>
You can move inside the inside, have different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, it's going to be able to share the main moments of the Olympics from 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a way of connecting with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can get there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose you just told you that, with just a lot of changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> for more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and you can be safe from ourselves?
How about living more <unk>
Or maybe they're those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What's the most important thing to you?
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people will blame creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably owe it to the number of creative people.
That's very good.
How many would you choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of us -- that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference.
The great geneticist of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense except for the light of the <unk>
But if they actually embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Does the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, it is, of course, the most interested in it.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
In the interval, there has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here a few years old.
It might seem to be very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that's used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, but it's the same protein, which comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry into the most bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> asks the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderful environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you might want to have no effort out of it.
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional firefly disruption of the <unk> <unk>
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what are we telling us about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something more adapted to the <unk>
In the vast symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in organisms -- every cell is simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters of the cell.
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
It enters the scene of sexual reproduction.
And a very important thing, with the emergence of sexual reproduction, which is the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to warn you, when I was a college student, I was like, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas 90 years old.
And one night someone hits your front door.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a magnificent dancer.
He looks at it and says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
I said, "OK, says, George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily just to make it different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to be healthy.
I wanted to recover the health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about going through the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view of an evolutionary view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic load into the next level of the <unk> and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all have the feeling that <unk> Allen when he said, "I don't want to make immortality through my work.
I want to warn you, not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily help longevity.
They don't necessarily embrace the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the smartest one.
Evolution favors the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, so it would be toxic enough into the vacuum, yet they have managed to do that an <unk> environment.
So what this means is, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if you look forward to the <unk> phase. I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first is that we don't know.
We've had a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning that would be that through medicine -- first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we're so excited that it is no longer possible to have the isolation necessary for evolution.
A second possibility is that there is an evolution of the natural kind of the natural kind of the natural type of the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when we kind of narrow distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, a practical and intriguing possibility intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you pick up on individual and familiar level.
Think about that if it could be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in your own body to make genetic settings for cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or to reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and sued 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
You know, you can get a whole sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost to the cost of 20,000 and in a week.
We don't have a lot to make the human genome actually make the human genome for <unk> and be increasingly the rest of all of us.
They come up those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses not only protecting us but they're going to induce <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against a vaccine against a plant of <unk>
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies, but if you could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the blood egg -- and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, remove the diabetes, to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want any more <unk>
And then, that same technology -- that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases will also allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be a guess.
And when we're in conditions of going this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years and we can take it at 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to get a better society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to pick up different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
We're going to build a society that's more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for evil, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. It was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight games.
So they immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot would draw the airplane with the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
They sell the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without noise.
And then he said three words.
Three words would be <unk> to have heard about it.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
I was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and didn't, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further on, I came up with a phrase, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it up.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity, it also gives place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I was talking about things that didn't mind with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
Within two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have a reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock is going to <unk> <unk> 14 <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break up in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I went, I had the feeling of, wow, it will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, "I love my life.
And that sadness was <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
One month later, I was in a performance.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point I got to connect those two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a great father.
I was given a miracle, not to die that day.
And that gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and to live in another way.
You who are flying around today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please don't be so -- but you can imagine, and how do you <unk>
What do you think that they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do your relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents that we had.
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many projects.
But the greatest thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has total paralysis,
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design business and animation, so obviously, for graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
And so we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met his brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he can communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that I saw Stephen <unk> not that all the people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're an important person and you have a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Anyone seen the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they are making it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead he signed a check, I didn't have the slightest idea of how he was going to <unk>
I committed to her brother and his father right there at that very moment, "OK, okay, this is the <unk> Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to start making his art again.
Because it's kind of ridiculous that someone who has so much in your inner cannot <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
And I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research Research, which has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you draw over that and the negative space is <unk>
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that they do, they say, are part of a life cycle.
First, they start with sexual organs -- then with bad words, then with the attacks in the Bush and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, and a lot of organization and a lot of a way to move the things on one side we had a couple of things.
One, we touch the doors of insurance companies and we got a machine that <unk> could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "You don't know. This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all over the <unk> world to our house.
My wife, and I, we moved into the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we would do something totally stupid and that when they die, they would have taken the frames from the walls and they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the shipping walk of <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> sunlight that we bought in the footsteps of <unk> Beach, a copper wire and things from Home <unk> and <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds up, we published the <unk> code, the software goes down for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no company to say "No."
There is no hospital to say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of designing intense sessions of all night, Tony went back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital.
And he went back to draw the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt the parking lot so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what we said, "This was the first time that I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and would get me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device -- but it's the equivalent of a physicist <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The awards were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong was something about us, and then in December, Time showed us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best of all of this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April this year at April of the <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles is going to have an exhibit called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
Nothing else in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer -- the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology -- I just recognized something and I was fascinated by wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you to all do every day when we find something we feel like to do, if you're not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations very difficult and at the same time a lot of dangerous time.
I went to the difficult.
I worked in a <unk> mine.
In the area of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this kind of fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career I've been engaging in situations like the only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that we can try to look at social issues in ways that we can find interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that would be entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little differently.
So some of you can have heard it or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered it to sale the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk -- my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes to and according to content could be held in the face, especially if I put it <unk> to you or your company to do it.
But I said that, it's a very good opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the name of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago I hadn't been able to afford it for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working, we look at the world of marketing from advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be done for something so hard or so dangerous to enter into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that is trying to do a film that is about the <unk> and the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film would be <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that all up at the bottom, at first at the end, it has images from brand all over the time, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the brand <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what?
I'm a <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure we use all the categories that we can on the film.
You might give you a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe, you have <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in "The <unk> <unk> ever <unk> the best drink you <unk> <unk> from "The largest <unk> movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the marks as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> -- MS: And actually exhibit the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I'd love you to help me make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're going to <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk>
MS: A million and a half a <unk>  Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worthwhile to convince a couple of big ones.
<unk> who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we look like a whole bunch of <unk>
MS: What do you think it's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most answers.
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> for the film or to be I?
JK:
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I got up. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to so many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the separate media scenario is not the idea that new vehicle worthy of attention is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this.
Actually no, there was no error.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images from <unk> on Google <unk>    -- this is one of the first images that were completed.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> of simulation or <unk> can easily detected or <unk> easily detected or easily <unk> that are characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- even the CEOs the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it actually really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's pretty risky.
When I started talking to the companies and telling you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to say, <unk> <unk>
We want you to make a story, but you know, <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie in some lie in some lie -- and there he was looking at as he used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and there's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off the way and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to find is a sudden of a sudden -- and I started to give myself a lot -- is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge huge, giant enormous, others who make small movies, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make big, giant Hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful, it's due to the markings associated with them.
And then my friends who have independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in movie?
Every time I'm getting out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say you're very cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there it would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a <unk> to <unk> to <unk> like that.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: Are we a little brand.
So we would get to the sort of little <unk> movies that we were going to do, we are rather a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that has other <unk>
So doing things like this, you know, remind people about the reason that this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: <unk> technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about some bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you cool more time? With better <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man on the street, and people like me, the common <unk>
They have to talk to me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good hand.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
And usually I take accessories.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk>
Woman 2: In addition to <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They put toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: So my brand is FedEx together because they were <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be entitled by Tom but often <unk> me at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they certainly could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
AT: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that you think about as people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come back and start in a place and in my case that you start and start in West West West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird stuff. I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what that serves us?
What's the <unk> What is <unk> What is <unk> you look now?
Why is it important to <unk> What does the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to have fear. What kind of Russian rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
AT: Thank you for your patience. Big <unk> Great Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of crazy in all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but they put it on your personality of <unk> "Give Morgan <unk> It's a <unk>
They were very good to put together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just going to fall into one of your strong points or in the other instead of focus on both.
Many companies tend to be able to avoid things that are not <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are like this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and brands themselves, those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your identity to brand, your brand, you brand, what would be?
Are you a <unk> You are somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk>
A little more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be playful like the contemporary contemporary -- like the contemporary contemporary -- and <unk> and bold as <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> magical or mystic as <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
Are you aware, sophisticated like <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, <unk> safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how now you use magnetic resonance centers to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for marketing like film.
We went to St. Paulo where advertising to the free air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are getting on the way in schools with problems in the U.S.
So the incredible thing for me is that the projects I've had the biggest answer or where I've been more successful in the ones that I've been talking with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They took the <unk> they took off their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try and directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to do to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 billion print in the media for this film.
This is just about two and a half weeks period.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies that we talk to you about: your customers not being different.
I've always believed that if you get a ticket if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train your employees at the amount of risk that is preparing all of their company to lack the <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to not have the opportunities for the opportunities to <unk>
Ultimately, we'll go forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> at risk.
From a <unk> we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today I'm going to be a bit of honesty to go through a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk, <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So I went back to the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the extracellular matrix -- the <unk> Foundation -- a check, Foundation, to be applied to my support for TED next year.
The idea behind the computer worm <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes you see are control systems in real time.
If we can engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they are completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus from Windows in a portable computer using an engineer used by an engineer to set up this gray box -- then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
<unk> enters the gray box hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing to know is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> the <unk> I used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we were going to explore our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> <unk> as a laboratory rat didn't like our <unk> <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense to me.
And after I experience with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk>
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect it is actually working on that place.
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that struck my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, let's say an American power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
better than we would do the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two minor pumps, a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally by people who obviously had all the internal information to it.
And we would have all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much of it <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me say, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code code.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find that code.
What we were looking at at first were calls to functions in the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to do it with the real world with potential potential for the real world.
We need <unk> theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, you remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it has to be a valuable valuable, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They're not several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant from <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back into an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find on code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
drums is that cell part within the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to get it slow down, and we will get into an obvious amount of effort to bring the engineers together, so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to decipher the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and the structures.
So, for example, the number <unk> stands up in that code, can't be <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains a <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it became better <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
I mean, it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken from several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> was to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making these <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We must not worry about other targets to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we showed -- really <unk>
There is the gray box and the top, you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values of the sensors for example, from pressure sensors and the sensors, provides <unk> code, which still runs during the attack, with false input data.
And believe it or not, these false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is feeding <unk>
It's great huh?
So the idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine goes from speed, you have to open an escape <unk>
Obviously, this can't do that a human operator.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> or the security system will be able to do it.
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a automobile <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> who disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you look at that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to be facing.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to face the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower superpower behind this.
There is one alone, and that's the United States -- fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you, <unk> Thank you.
I want you to imagine a robot that you can carry on and give them <unk> skills or another one that makes users of wheelchair go up and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a big force, which is also increasing your speed, and it helps for example, to drive your balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and other things like that.
This is not an idea that is <unk>
To show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, should take on their back -- a 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to bring even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk> with chronic back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk> Human Human
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton -- I can take you 90 kilos of land terrain for a lot of hours.
Your flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the look at the users of the wheels, about what I'm feeling particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people -- all over the time, all over the world.
It's a percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with very young people, with damage to the column that when their life is going to start -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that is blown up.
His only option, many times -- for brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years injury in the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't be able to walk over 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got some sensors on it.
It's completely not lying on crutches that send signals to the computer on board here on the back.
There are some batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing down there was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all <unk> motion.
Shortly after that, a doctor went into my room in the hospital in the hospital, and he said, "You know, you'll never go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last little bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, I've been allowed to learn how to <unk> it costs down to <unk> rocks and even riding a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future life -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the chairs of chairs from the wheels, to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex with saying hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Spiderman.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of the forests of rainforests in Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimps, their closest living kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known to their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimps are dominated by big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created a special thing, because this leads to a very tolerant society where death is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big <unk>
They live in the depths of the <unk> <unk> and it's been very hard to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been prolonged by decades and caused nearly as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also <unk> the survival of the Bonobo.
Illegal meat trade and deforestation makes you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden laughter <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes of the <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to handle conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game game you see the roots of the laughter, the dance and the dance and the human ritual,
The glue is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> <unk> and I'm not talking about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
I just think in this case I love, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because you get this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with a little bit of water.
I think, as we sometimes played by themselves, and we explored the limits of our own inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world more and harder to greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But, <unk> the maximum ability of game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like less appropriate to play, you can be the moments when it is the most <unk>
So in my fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together as they do, creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of the captain of a department of a fire body.
And in our city, where volunteers have paid a highly qualified staff to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so he had a pretty high chance to go.
But still, there was a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to go back and <unk> the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money which, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I entered a building in burning to be alive just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to join the house.
I need to be <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
Do you know?
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the fire firemen -- that height of them had just finished off the fire and walked into the main room looking for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load around the ladder to where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog in the front door.
We took away from the house the <unk> for the home owner where, as you would expect, their treasure. got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the home owner <unk> for the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at on the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
In my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer and kindness of generosity and kindness on a logarithmic scale, but also acts of grace and courage to individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made it, or are there to be -- remarkable levels of success -- I'd like to remind you this: Don't hold them.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
They took food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
They are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So they trained the <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange -- but I'm a big fan of the concrete.
The first blocks of concrete has been built in <unk> with a very simple idea of concrete modules that fit together each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build new things that we, as buildings or bridges and a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He called the <unk>
And in a few years, <unk> bricks came to all the home.
It's estimated that there have been over 400 billion or 75 bricks in the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete, <unk> in the world, and converted it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year in the labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that led us from a world of aesthetic brick to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete, block allows to create much greater circuits and more complex circuits a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't think about it that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change the <unk>
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is they're linked through magnets.
So you can't put it wrong.
The bricks have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the pink is the stream, the rose and the orange color is the wire.
So you just put together a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue with green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to be connected and connecting and <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk> gestures in it.
To make it faster or more slow or slow down, you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to become <unk> ready to use.
<unk> sounds, <unk> <unk> <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given to kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how you start to understand the electronics in every day that don't learn in schools.
For example, how does one light light works, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also brought them to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago we took to the designers of the Rhode School of Island, which has no experience in engineering, just wood and paper and said, "Do you do something.
Here's an example of a project that has made a <unk> cannon <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be able to do all.
So <unk> has open code.
You can visit the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for getting involved in the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> take a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
We can continue to better leave the video to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I was <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and would be like a few Peace <unk>
Would you have a few members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending the Third World to the Third World <unk>
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
Meet <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would look for a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody is trapped by snow, because he knows it's not very good to paint fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for this so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were in there in February and at that moment that was very much last year.
They realized that the city will never wiped out.
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- which is the citizens <unk> with shovels the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, he put it up.
If you don't, someone can be <unk>
Or it has a component anyway?
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads somewhere.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this app realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to get the <unk>
It's very important that they work with these <unk> but people <unk>
That's why citizens have to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just launched it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that plan use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition generally takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that by the normal canals would have taken at least two and over two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there is a project in the power of California and the California power of California that all the time there is 2,000 billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows in a couple of days and it spreads in viral it is kind of a shot shot from warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to tackle the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as an issue of an immune institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good at the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And not only is it <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
They're not given to the government.
Can you feel a great frustration to that, but they don't get to <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we left the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that put us crazy, the government is essentially the words of Tim <unk> <unk> "What do we do together because they don't get <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you, because the things are changing.
The policy doesn't support the government.
And given the government ultimately <unk> -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way it would think about how to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of the phone and information center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark any 311 in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> in the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally, he said, "Hey, you can open the door to the house, put it very hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. It worked.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a media application, and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
We don't get that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York <unk> in Boston.
One day, this actually comes into this <unk> <unk> in my bucket -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make it <unk>
The <unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back home. I went home.
Good nights, <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to collaboration, distributed failure.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people will be able to help others.
So, an citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could be connected to the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, they would save the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people get it, but they think you're the input of the other.
Our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will prescribe our values and really <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow ocean.
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot contempt.
But it is that <unk> what that keeps us from that is that we funded as something that is working on our against that other thing, and as a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work to have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real work of government happens.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the request from <unk> <unk> about the climate reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have been distracted by the government, it's time we asked ourselves, what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we have to go to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in behalf of all?
We can't stop with government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act -- you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old so that I, <unk> I'm a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everybody will speak.
You can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when you face the government problem, they don't really care about making their voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring the work to the work to program applications that will work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be clean up a hydrant, taking away from a trash hydrant, which has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to get these <unk> and so many people do it.
But these applications are like a digital <unk> that we are not just consumers, we're not just consumers of government we pay and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the citizen anymore.
So I want to ask everyone here when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or we will be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I have spent most of my life in the communities in communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have a impact on the world.
On times, if something comes from TED, you have a sense and a force that would have no other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
We've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, you can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
That's why I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of right, my work.
I learned that from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia on <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery.
She was hard and she was also <unk>
When I was a little kid, and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a nice <unk>
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> and I was like, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he told him no, I loved it again and if he said yes, I was allowed in peace.
He had this human quality that makes you always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower of 10.
On times, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running around everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up a morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At the beginning, I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him, and she looked at him, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, he took me through my hand, and he said, "Come <unk> The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out, and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I don't know that. I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Just want to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to focus on, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell you, is that you always are going to do the right thing -- even right though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell you, is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural <unk> I have a <unk> brother and a younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and my sister and went to the forest.
We barely get the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he took my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing as us.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I didn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me at <unk>
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
And I landed the eyes with the strength and the <unk> and he said, "Oh, not to be in thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I say it by the power he has identity.
When we create the right kind of identity -- we say things to others who really doesn't make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't think power to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My uncles died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
They had 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the highest incarceration rate of the world.
We have seven million people at parole.
And this mass <unk> in my mind, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, or black communities is so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of every three black men in the age of 18 and 30 years is in jail or a parole.
In New York City around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young women are in jail or at parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and <unk> than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not our own.
We are <unk>
I think interesting.
We are looking at our work some of the kind of developments as well.
In my state in my state, as well as in other states, you care about rights by always if you have criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of male population has certainly lost the right to the vote.
And if we projected it over the next 10 years a loss of rights to be as high as it was before they were able to get the law of the right to the vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was given to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no chance to get out.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They would give people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in some sense you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty is defined by error.
In every nine person, you have identified one who is innocent which is <unk> and released from death row.
An innocent rate, an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not allow you to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be designed if you have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history, I'm talking about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the age that began at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are people older than they come to me, and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, <unk> <unk> to people who stop saying that in our history -- for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we wanted each other.
We were constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to commit them with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome the segregation with the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany talking about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation, and he said, "You know it's well disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> We don't have death row in Germany.
We will never be able to be here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There is no way with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational to us, and we <unk> and <unk> we would put us to <unk>
Let's get it out of this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in mostly <unk>
We could not afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we really don't care about these things that hard, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. Get creativity.
We love entertainment.
But then lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both things.
I've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never come to TED.
If you think about it in a way, it's something that's inside of us.
It's true that we need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
With innovation, with creativity. The development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas from ideas -- also because of the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us not only in the bright and <unk> but also the dark thing and the difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in <unk> and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is practically in the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to really be truly human -- if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> it to <unk>
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> was called me to tell me, <unk> comes the <unk> We're going to bring us to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I was like, "I am <unk> <unk>
So she was like, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read him <unk>
So I was going and just <unk> them.
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice is <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give it my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences for life, not freedom to fight for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave him all my best speech and he finished and looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> exhausted, very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> got my finger in the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think that the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way that those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie. It's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not that it's a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's what it isn't.
I actually think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very exhilarating -- very exhilarating -- not to judge our technology, for our design and rational capacity.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat the powerful and powerful people, but because of the way they treat poor, they sell them the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my own <unk>
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> <unk> and 14 years old, they have been <unk> so they were being used as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge convert someone into what's not it?
Justice <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night was awake by God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He was 14 years old, a <unk> poor, white.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my black client for 14 is treated like a privileged white <unk> <unk>
In <unk> I found that there had been <unk> conduct in the <unk> of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how this country has no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> it had sent the cut.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this stupid.
I got up to the car and I was really passionate about <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came down from the car. They went to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met the stairs when I met a black man who was <unk> from court.
When he saw me, she came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "I'm <unk> I said yes.
And then I approached me and I was <unk>
And I was blown away in the ear, in the ear,
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my inner identity with my identity that we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went into the room of audiences.
When the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I went away." And we started shaking.
People started to go. They were all <unk>
I was the guy who had written those crazy things.
They got police policemen the prosecutors the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and everybody mentioned, because we're talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of my eye to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and try to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black man with the face of concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> <unk> was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> ran on the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black man stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> room to tell this young man who keeps his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED, because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
We can't really be truly human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see a clear desire for the audience -- this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are various opportunities close to it.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort to <unk> the funds that you spend today in political policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars worth of death in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the cases of homicide -- not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get at all.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are <unk> to make security at security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge decline in the crime in the United States, over the last three decades.
And part of the explanation, you say it has to do with the highest <unk> rate.
What would you say you might believe that?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes in violence.
It's the wrong thing against drugs.
This is why this is a dramatic rise in the population of the population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to chain of stealing a bicycle, with small crimes against ownership, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about this right here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for you to come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats for Bin Laden.
<unk> #2: <unk> in Somalia.
<unk> 4: <unk>

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the press media would prefer to make negative news, because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are receiving many, many more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us to survive, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called the amygdala.
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could be hurt to hurt us.
That's why a <unk> stories of stories, looking at the negative.
That old saying from the <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of a week 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, is not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong for worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe in change, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe it's tremendous progress that has done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the extinction extinction -- the scarcity of water and <unk> no doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and in the long run, we've just got them.
Let's take it in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita income is <unk> around the world.
The child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food is the cost of transportation and communication, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles Kenny that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
Many people forget.
And we continue to attract higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators and air conditioning and cars.
<unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of that <unk>
So a lot of this is the technology and then lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps in this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price yield in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone they have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and 1,000 times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look two things on this curve.
First, soft that is -- in good and bad time in the war and peace, in depression and on the rise.
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law to the left, <unk> goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And in this curve, the Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of Autodesk call electronic computing and networks, the 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuel vaccines and food, digital medicine -- the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" Watson, of <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline I had.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to opponents <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It serves the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on your phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
They went to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with silver, and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum is the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> to Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth's mass doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made the aluminum stuff that we use it as it was <unk>
Let's take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the shortage of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a <unk> planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about bust but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. power -- solar power will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have plenty of water.
Let's talk now about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed into the Voyager spacecraft, over the Earth, in 1990, after country <unk>
<unk> a famous picture, how do you get it?
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water.
Yes, the <unk> is seawater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the planet, but here's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, I gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of water from drinking water to the day of any <unk> fresh water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought to do an important test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which that will be Coca-Cola in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation that has this technology today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And from having a smart phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have happened.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens of thousands of dollars -- video -- images, libraries of books and music, technology technology -- now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes in, when you have the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device with the <unk> and because it has <unk> they can be extracted from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the load of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we won't be able to call the health and the first place, to avoid the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just passed the brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to help the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected together.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been able to get to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you get? What <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D printing and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion people of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
How about a voices of voices never before.
What if you give them the biases, wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and to be able to act for the first time?
What about these three billion.
And if they are contributions that we can't afford to.
One of the things that I learned with the X Prize, is that young equipment, guided by their passion with one of of course, can do things that were <unk> things that could only do the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There is a program that probably some of you have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
The folds determine the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together, and they started <unk>
And it's been shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovator <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three new minds of new minds that we were interested in to work on the solution of large challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades in front of a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very powerful idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I will give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You know, you might think they were going to be <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually take fish.
And he described one of them as <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught him a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> are still saying they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a Lagos in Western Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
You see, it was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There were about 20 feet -- the black beard <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and used for a good moment, so I was made more of the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to five inches.
We have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were even happy.
And fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing is changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was terrified in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- I mean, we started in the <unk> Europe conducted a lot of development projects.
fishing development was meant to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty good, called the <unk> four.
I went out fishing in it, and we ran the South Sea of China in China <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture there was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And the majority of fish are blobs of tiny <unk> the remains of coral reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then you start commercial fisheries.
The bottom is from being a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are collected every time they have never fish.
But there's no documented.
We don't remember it.
You know, the point of starting on the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use images I would get in the beginning of their conscious life, like normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they didn't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the wind of changes.
And at the end of the end, he will keep a few <unk>
And that, in a big extent, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> it's thin.
You don't lose animals place.
You lose animals unusual animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a huge loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea synonymous with large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
With a few fish -- but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some <unk> like Captain such as the captain would have a lot of fish in this area cannot be used, or usually they don't use the scientists in the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we lived in corporate societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the enormous marine paper can be protected by the protected area.
Because with marine protected areas we actually set up the past.
<unk> the past people cannot conceive of because the starting point has run and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected protected area and they can benefit from the vision that they allow them to delete their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the West West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema might be able to fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, it has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube <unk>
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are doing <unk> and what importance does that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today, the website makes any of us, or from our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
They go over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, only a little percentage goes viral receive lots of views and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities and factor.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of popular summer last summer.
<unk> didn't talk to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the video to the <unk>
<unk> like Jimmy <unk> are presented to us new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider public.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   All of you want to get the weekend in a week --                          I won't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> strands is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day in particular <unk>
Well, he took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science Science was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators will embrace a point of view and share it with a wider audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> from <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation coming together with a <unk> music.
So, that's it.
This year, you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the world's community <unk>
There was <unk>
Someone made an old version of the ancient one.
And then the international <unk>
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke something that we all can form in.
Because today we don't just have <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> 5,000 miles or RS:
What does it might have been written to make this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video for a minute, only that truly unique and unexpected can be solved by the way these things have done.
When a friend of mine told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't really get interested in it.
Casey <unk> I'm going to be <unk> by the <unk> but there are often obstacles that can be achieved properly from the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise to the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> I managed to get five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing that we make creative shape.
And all of this leads to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of astronomers creative communities, and totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- which we all have access to, and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's barely the current media -- but they will take the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose whole life had been supported by the only one of unit and freedom in his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long, friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let it have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it would happen.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the dawn <unk> decrease to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two young girls.
For her, life had meant to a <unk> task -- the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the ocean <unk> <unk>
All adults knew about risks.
The greatest fear was the rape and death.
Like most of the adults my mother had a <unk> <unk>
If we first came out, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the steady rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into each <unk> and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to <unk> for six hours.
But I remember the lights out of the oil platform before the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I would end the journey was too much for it, and the first apple I tried to, given for the men from the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four more than three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike the middle class unlike the middle class -- whose existence of <unk> in <unk> had no sense of right.
The smells that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> were traded among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, then on a car assembly -- working six days, double shift.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a <unk> title of <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and math, wouldn't matter what you should be <unk> which was usually clothes -- it was usually <unk>
Two pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> went back home."
At home, where?
Something in me <unk>
It was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I would lie in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we moved on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother suffered from the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer shop and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> angry and <unk> kids caught in between two worlds.
They looked for <unk> and <unk>
And they were created.
I lived in ice worlds.
In one, it was the classical Asian student, relentless at what I was talking about myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives -- increasingly, <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of these were given help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was elected by the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of the <unk>
So a resident anonymously in <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk to you where I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the psychic and comfort in a forgotten suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> over the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we get on the boat.
It was never a choice.
<unk> she said, "and you won't be what you don't expect.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about, the more I was to talk to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they are living on the border of as possible.
And even though I finished my graduate work, I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new at the scene -- and not just it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, but maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside can mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a power there, a optimism <unk> a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I put in a small group of people who the motto cannot <unk> it was an extra challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant soup of soup that all of us.
It would go down to the entrance to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up.
I made a decision to move to the United States.
after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
It had not changed for centuries.
His father died after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of her husband, it caused an <unk> to the <unk> and bringing the cause to her, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It cannot be done to be wrong.
I was in the shower for a hotel to <unk> when she died, <unk> miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw him standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to get her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us were and how life built us now -- we can see that the men who have come to our lives we would have <unk>
The defeat would have very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for right?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, diving brave at each <unk> the steady rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see them for you to do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is today in the fourth or fifth line.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a cart and put it out in the sky.
Now we do it with an airplane now.
At that time, when we <unk> the great prince of Indian warrior Indian, he had <unk> he took a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
And I would tell you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, not kill her.
As a child my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this part of 50 years was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile clocks -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
Tell our inspiration.
And so I came up with it, I was dropped to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than kill her.
I read books since 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
And put the text with the image, the animation, the sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we love that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  It says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic magic of childhood, those ideas that I did from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out to me.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And they actually light your way into what it subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag up to this magic device within the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy book, there's always been maps but static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and this is a contemporary of contemporary things.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and moist book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a children's story.
In a story that involves current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> glued to their <unk> they have not left to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology we can get our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the children are not doing it.
So in order to reclaim this field of childhood you have to go out and, in a chapter, you get a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is a set of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, the Earth and the technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book, we decided to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video turned and through <unk> it sees a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants of the house.
And at a moment the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and try to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are dealing with technology and magic and technology and technology come along one another.
We use the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and love love that we sat through with a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or maybe not all of us, but most projects of <unk> fail to listen to.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's something very simple.
It has a <unk> <unk>
Every morning <unk>
And yeah, I have a challenge you can see.
I put the challenge to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I'm going to tell you, sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. And so he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that way, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week, it's available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to take away from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, share with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients take a position, they come back to reclaim control and to be <unk> of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care, because of the challenges we face, as the firing shot of health care costs to demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did I want to share it with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls, in <unk>
Maybe we have in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please see a <unk> where, when it is open, because sometimes they open up in a time parking lot and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and somebody would <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their cellular phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish to <unk>
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so we will help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you go on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us observe these <unk>
You might be messaging or <unk> people for example, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in the place.
Please forgive me in this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they are photographs that can't take on their cameras.
My interest in the photograph came up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion by drawing but it was a little bit different because when you use the camera the process was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera that the process ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this is a building on a very small road.
But it has a twist on it.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or photos like <unk> dark and colorful at the same time, but with the common goal to keep the real <unk>
And when I say quote, <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way like photography.
And so you have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem true.
They're the details or the <unk>
Put light?
What do you create the <unk>
Sometimes illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not actually about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way, you can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if they exist.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really in combining different realities.
And the things that make a photograph look like realistic I think these are those in which we don't even know the things around us in our everyday life.
But in combining pictures is very important -- it's very important because it's something to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are <unk> you must have the same kind of light.
And these two images can be taken on the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of different images with a perfect person.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal thing, I think it's easier to create a place that would find it because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The coast is a different location.
The <unk> part was just captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, I even made red <unk> house to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic result I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that the results can be very beautiful, and rather <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a folder of me.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general side.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> microprocessors versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other that we tend to see, is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is new.
Here's something weird happening.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
It was more intensity, because to write about paper.
Why do we bring technology into technological scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to <unk> the diagram would look like something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you go to an example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve.
But if something like this, it's a <unk> change.
If the technology of shipping is as fast as the <unk> past tomorrow tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But we don't go through that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented in the history of technological development of an ongoing growth that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is is to look at these <unk> curves we see they're not forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
It would take one of two things.
Or you will turn into a typical curve, I know like this until something totally different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we'll be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new shape.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, "What is that new way that <unk> the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're engaged in it.
I remember a child going on in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think that's because we feel something that's going on.
It's a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The scale of time that I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about two and two billion years when the Earth was a big rock with many chemicals that would spread around it.
If we look at the way those chemicals organize us, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you about a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, it was floating about oil from oil with all sorts of chemicals in their inside.
Some of those drops of oil containing a particular combination of chemicals that made them to bring materials out of the outside and the drops grew in the places.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were <unk> cell forms of oil.
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time they were <unk> they would be a distribution of the chemicals that we get.
So each of that was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow become better at the time of adding the chemical <unk> they grew more <unk> more chemicals and <unk>
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life -- very simple, but things are <unk> interesting when these blobs learned the trick of <unk>
In some ways that we don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemist called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution <unk> a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide from people from the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the ordinary letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and it took it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it on a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
And the writing was an interesting step.
This made these cells were happy about another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things were very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and to communicate information forming the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to grow communities that in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
In that way, or <unk> together, or whatever if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community they would become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came so close to the fact that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next stage interesting for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that are able to separate communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have lots of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and there were more interesting levels that the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These were starting to make information information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more of processing information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures of <unk> understanding and transmitting information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gives you an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not at the time of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, to learn not to eat some fruits because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these kinds of processing processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals who ate those fruits of the death.
So the fact that the constructed nervous system will build these information structures greatly accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the more <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
And I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea in your head.
I'm here sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated that we turned it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we have started doing <unk>
Now we go through periods of similar periods to <unk> organisms.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape, the video tape -- the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you about took a billion years each.
The next few days the nervous system and the brain took a few hundred million years old.
And so, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, it looks like just a few decades.
The process, I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my job designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that employment for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to engage in conventional ways.
I don't know that every transistor in that connections machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine, and the machine with that does something that you can't do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
So we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and you will take those that more <unk> than we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tidy numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order to numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, fortunately, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
Let's put those and forth to the rest.
And now we <unk> those that better ordered the numbers.
And back to <unk> following a process of analog to analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, which <unk> children, who were <unk> and that the children will get the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of product combinations that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please, repeated the <unk>
Let's get it again.
They have a few mutations in it.
And he tries new and trying to share with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that were listening to numbers so absolutely perfect.
In fact, it's a lot more <unk> programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to take them to see how they work.
They're very strange programs.
But they have the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the safety of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives depend on this.
I once went in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he grabs a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so they could run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and that's why I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at an analog moment, when they were <unk> when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we are all part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think stop here before I was <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've got enough time to let me give up some of my false <unk>
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Wide <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of getting <unk> <unk> talk about the statistics and using them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hopefully many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talk about 300, in a <unk> who <unk> 300.
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the game of game without being <unk> and that anybody who tries to throw it to the first base of time, not to get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really good, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 car <unk> I get four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League of the League of <unk> <unk> to execute more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I'm going to take this to my medical world where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you have a surgeon that has also a record for 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place remote and a dear to be wanted to have two clogged arteries, and your family doctor derived to a cardiologist whose record for <unk> is <unk>
But you know something?
She is getting a lot of getting a lot of a lot of this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But they would ask them.
What do you think should be the average of a heart surgeon or a heart surgeon or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
They very well.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in any medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and I include the mandate to be perfect.
I never, ever have a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a Protestant obsessional student.
Once, a fellow in the high school said that Brian Goldman studied until an blood <unk>
Just which.
I went into my little <unk> in the North Museum of the General Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> to the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the differential diagnosis and frequent <unk>
And I even knew that <unk> diagnosis of how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And while we get more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if I went down, then I would know everything, or more possible to all of all, because I would get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the <unk>
I was a resident at a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the emergency school service to the emergency room where I worked.
I was assigned to <unk>
And when emergency requested to come to a cardiologist I got to attend that patient.
I will report to the head of residents.
When I saw the <unk> lady was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I heard it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which is a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart keeps going to work and, instead of pump the blood forward, goes to lungs, these are <unk> and so they are <unk> and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it was not hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment of the treatment for him.
I gave him <unk> and medication.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that he could get out of liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I sat very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes actually.
I sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get up the phone or did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to provide <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
And maybe I didn't want to be a resident at a constant <unk>
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even holding my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice on my inside and say, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so unsure that it was until I asked the nurse who <unk> the Mrs. <unk> <unk> who is good if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, <unk> <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high school and the ambulance together with the people who took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I went to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that moment I did something I don't do normally, right?
It happened to the emergency emergency service to home.
And there another nurse, not that I was talking about the lady <unk> before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors would be <unk>
Other people fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
<unk> the patient who sent her <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I came back and on the edge of death.
After an hour of having come home to her house, after I gave him the high school, he suffered a collapse, and her family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock of severe.
It was barely breathing and was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave him medication.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> were in intensive therapy and waiting for all the hope that they would get.
And in the two or three days it was apparent that we never will.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they would get to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, he left her go. The old lady, wife, and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
So the next few weeks -- I was going to go through it, and I experienced for the first time, shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford it with your colleagues.
You make peace and it will never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad about inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that meant it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would put things out and made sure that I didn't get paid.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why do we choose medicine?
Little by that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day it was opened the sky and finally went out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not making more mistakes I would be allowed to leave those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work again.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I received a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
He pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, he was a little <unk>
He sent him penicillin, and sent him home.
But while he ran to the door kept pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my head asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can Google Google -- it's an infection, not the throat, but from the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He, fortunately, not <unk>
They were <unk> antibiotics by <unk> and <unk> in the few days.
And I went through the same part of shame and <unk> then I would go back and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
It turned out an X-ray X-ray -- but it turned out to normal -- a colleague who was checking out the patient perceived a certain sensitivity in the right quadrant, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
She took liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it and to see some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon.
They were both operated on, and they recovered well.
But every single case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful years have been for the last five years.
They were embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get my eyes and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tell me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you show it to you that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital, the wrong leg -- my leg would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> who make mistakes and not. Those who don't sleep and the ones that I know; they have <unk> results, and they have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get away from medicine to people who make mistakes.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study for medical <unk> and medical failures to learn how to do the first article I wrote for the Toronto Star Trek to my <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every single day, where one of the 10 drugs are going on in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where bacterial infections are increasingly and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die in this country, they die <unk> for medical errors in it.
The U.S. Medical Institute set 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A self-organizing system where knowledge goes up every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on my chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain on my chest, and it comes to alcohol <unk> and with alcohol to breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get away, and we eliminate all the criminal professionals -- well, not to be nobody.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art -- this is a habit saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the <unk> to the head of <unk> <unk> blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> to go down to the head and go to <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, you know it, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
You know, the mistakes of other people don't have the intention of <unk> but in a loving way of support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I have a human <unk>
And I feel so much but effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day of <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
And recently, I made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to pick an average American is about 70 to a day.
Not a lot, in a research followed during a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers held the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time that we would make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 required an hour or more of his time.
Now think of your elections.
Do you know how many of you belong to the age of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do you figure out how to drive those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> to choose to the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day. Are you ready to hear the problem of the <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> level of very, very <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different fruits and vegetables and about 25 of water <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I would ask myself, "Why never I buy nothing?
This is the shelf oil shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 classes -- including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from trees.
I once decided to go to the manager and I said, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that came out every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had to do different classes.
You put a post to <unk> right to the tent.
We put out of six <unk> or 24 flavors -- and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
Who stopped when there was 24, only three percent came to buy <unk>
When there was six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide we don't buy <unk> we probably <unk> <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the behavioral overload affects us in the very good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when this doesn't get us wrong.
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for retirement retirement in about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of affordable funds available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we discovered that there was actually a <unk>
We had <unk> plans from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the greater the number of funds, there were less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans for about 60 funds, the rate of participation came to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, the consequences of the negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the more the number of choice, more people will be able to avoid actions or investment.
As long as there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are afraid to optimize human well-being future.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they would make the decision, even when this is against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less than <unk> even though they seem to go better.
The main reason is that we were able to look at that huge variety of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, to contrast and to choose that stunning <unk>
Today I want to give you to you today -- simple techniques that we have, in a way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to be cut, get rid of rare options, there will be an increase in sales <unk> there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw about 10 percent increase in sales.
When the <unk> <unk> took rid of the products to be <unk> of cats that are less likely to be achieved by <unk> in <unk> for two larger sales and under the costs.
You know that banks today, average people offer 45 products.
In a Walmart store they offer about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come up with how to handle better choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the <unk> program.
All the Harvard employees are instantly <unk> to a safe fund of life.
Those of you who really want to choose for 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk> options.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they cannot be able to make their <unk>
This afternoon, before this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you an applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I could actually hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first stage that in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images would make it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the choice of choices, which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very much very specific <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent more 30 to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit cards than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get them more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being used to a <unk> plan.
That meeting was the way that we were <unk> we made a little bit of <unk>
What we added was that he would give up the staff who would think of the positive things that they would do in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a hall of magazines.
What we saw is that in the grocery supermarkets, along the northeast corridor of magazines can contain from <unk> different types of <unk> to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to do it.
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Take a <unk>
<unk> Okay, here's a few of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Take a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This rating framework is totally useless.
<unk> must indicate something to whom they are not going to be aware of.
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funds.
You're supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think about if you just get it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let me make a good decision for a car buying a car.
This is a car German producer that enables you to completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, and put it together.
And these vary in the number of choices offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is to vary the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many options, 56 colors, just a few times four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go in a few options, four boxes, 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you have the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that are going from many choices to time, and they would take the defect over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which the information shows up.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although we choose the change box doesn't tell you about the preferences of the decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> to eliminate alternate alternatives -- <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> the complexity.
All of these techniques that I've shown you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices, we can practice art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in the East Germany in the East Germany, if you had a typewriter had to be <unk> to the government.
You had to register a picture of example written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of texts.
If they were writing with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West of the West, we don't think somebody could do this, how much we can do this, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow dots on every page that follows a pattern that makes them own one and their printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the Web.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, the <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys make their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media by stealing money from our accounts when we buy them in <unk> or steal our keys from our cards when we bought it on a <unk> computer.
The secret American service, two months ago, <unk> the <unk> account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> <unk>
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most crimes would happen online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we observe today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, motivate them to motivate them, they motivate them.
People like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who make it for protest and the last group are the national United States that the governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall last fall because of a <unk>
They were able to be safety from the site and hit a <unk>
I was asked last week with representatives of the Dutch government and asked one of the leaders if they were to <unk> the death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how people die from a attack on these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do we use them?
Well, you need to be a website with <unk> services like <unk> services like <unk>
Except for <unk> a foreign <unk>
And they were going to cause the <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters the <unk> secret police headquarters in April 2011 and during the <unk> they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, the Western governments provide the tools to be able to do this to their citizens.
But the Western governments are also doing this.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it's more there.
They were going on the connection to the Internet.
So even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If you could be confident in our governments today in 2011, any right that we will be able to have today, it's going to be forever.
<unk> blindly blindly at any future government in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be concerned about the next 50 years.
Here's where I live in Kenya, in the south part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi doesn't have fences in the bulk of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one that they killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead, I felt very bad because it was the only bull I had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of the lions.
They were people who protect our community and livestock and livestock -- and they're mad about the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at the age of six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were scary.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because even helping lions see the pen away.
I don't know about <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick the lions so they believed it was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day and watched the <unk> and they went on the first day and they went back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I just went out and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come from.
And I found that lions are afraid of the light that's moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> of a <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel charge the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And this is how they see the lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so that you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One is from this grandmother.
She had killed lots of animals and lions and asked if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
<unk> You can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now through Kenya, to frightening predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also being used to be <unk>
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So, a year ago, it was just a child in the meadows of the savanna -- I was holding the cows of my father, and I used to see flying airplanes and I was saying it would someday be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer and pilot when it grow.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other electric forms.
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do something like <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know they invented electric fences -- but I want to do my own.
CA: So you know, I read it once once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I got a <unk>  CA: On the foot, Richard <unk> Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to take it on every single step that I get friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would get all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
I sometimes wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until it all changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks before.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the short time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't delete my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child lying in his arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine killed North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
It also became more and more prevalent the power of energy, everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, barely across the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Africa.
But many people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating on the river, in the river.
I can't disclose the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and encouraged me to the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then I would <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and say the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an official told another, "This was a fake report -- she's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for <unk> <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding jobs, everybody else can be able to make it in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity -- I decided to be a risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I would expect.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start to learn my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where's I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call my pride of mine.
Although I went to the life in South Korea, it was not easy, I made a plan. I started to study for the research exam to college.
Just when I started to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities took some money than sent my family, and as a punishment -- my family was going to be moved to the force to a location outside the <unk>
They had to rush away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and walked me to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went into a number of times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a police officer.
He asked everybody, and he started to ask them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me, but I fortunately believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe border guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all for free my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison to a short distance from the South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man ask myself, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would say to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained to the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for the other two North Koreans and got them out of prison.
I took him with all my heart, and I said, "Why would you <unk>
"Not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the people who are <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
<unk> stranger will be given a new hope for me and for the people to <unk> when most of them would be.
And I showed me that kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
Therefore, we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices, of work, and more.
We can also act like the bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us follow in touch with family <unk> and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Center.
This is Center for <unk> stores for fast food, <unk> terrain.
So the planners of the city came together and thought, we're going to change the name of the South Center so that it represents something more -- so they changed Los Angeles in the world -- as if this is going to be <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --    <unk> <unk> food, <unk> terrain.
Just like <unk> millions of other American Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles home Center for food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles in the South Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I emphasize this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
The problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a forest forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet there.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, Green <unk> we get together and we started planting our food forest forest -- <unk> trees -- you know, the nine vegetables <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of paid <unk> made by gardeners of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and all we do is free.
And the garden.
And then someone gets <unk>
The city went on top and <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to take my yard, the <unk> got made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A judicial order for planting food in a piece of land that no one had ever <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's look at it.
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That means 20 Central Central <unk>
That's enough room for planting <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why the hell don't you look like this?
We have a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there. I got my kids there.
I was scared to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to give you my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
Just like an artist artist <unk> walls, <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the courtyard, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You would be surprised to see what the Earth can do, if you let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how kids affects the kids.
gardening is the most controversial act and provocative that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one time, that a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night and they were in my backyard, I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people will steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, I'm not afraid you're going to go to <unk>
That's what it is on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take, but at the time, I want you to give you your <unk>
There was another chance that I put a garden in a haven for <unk> at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, they were helped to download the truck.
It was great, I shared their stories about how this had affected me and how they used to plant with their mom and their grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed was so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who are coming, they work and work on every volunteer plan.
If kids cultivate <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they will eat you --  But if none of these things are told if you're not taught how food affects your mind and your body, they eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're stuck in, I see the color guys that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who will spread from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you have the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plan. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to wear containers and turn them into cafes healthy.
I don't think about it.
I'm not talking about free things, because it's free not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is putting people working on people, getting kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You know, the <unk> take their <unk>
That is the weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you're not called to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making shit.
If you want to see me, they come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very close road.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, it rains, a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that we have <unk>
And especially if you go <unk> on your bike and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we built roads, like the Netherlands, very close to the cities, would you want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to do <unk> <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can pass through it, so all the rain water flows over the side and you have a road that is easy to drive, and they don't make water out of it.
Noise will be disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See that on this road the stones on the surface are <unk>
So first a stone, then several more and more, and so on, and so on, and <unk> -- well, I won't do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more harm.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> He's ready.
And you know, of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between the stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light -- these <unk> the glue -- this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you're <unk> they will be <unk> and they will spread from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials from <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use steel, steel from that to clean up, and we can cut the <unk> steel in very small pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with small chunks of steel in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat a steel melt off, the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones put it back to the surface.
I used a <unk> oven, because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm now going to take out to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples out there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to get it out.
So you donated a piece of road, 400 feet of the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a test lane test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did age the samples, we put a lot of payload into them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life on the surface of the road, even double the life on the surface of the road, to save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how the repairability behaves like.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC in his little gray radio <unk>
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could <unk>
Every day, we took a different route for nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us would come in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every time the school was close to a week of a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote African province in that their daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father would get it.
But my educated mother became mastery.
This is her.
It took back two years ago, just to turn our house into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk to not educate her children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember that there were moments when I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and she didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father was like, <unk> daughter of me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can let your money leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay for your education, we will.
So, you still want to do not <unk>
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud of graduate in <unk> College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from their home to the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my college degree, but I also was the first woman, and I am the first woman, I carry it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I think, in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what we <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to take on the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> them by them, despite the face of an unknown opposition in front of it.
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to her village, and literally he was thrown out of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would get it to try.
He <unk> now, if I said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they often are the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> girls who went to school they count in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
It was that these changes would not last long last long after the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who are <unk> by them, I see a future <unk> and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> I got it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the Tunisian revolution was inspired by the <unk> massive <unk> revolution as well as the <unk>
An forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> within and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> they were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of freedom, dignity of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a courage to confront the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East to the west to the west to the south.
Finally, after a six months of brutal war, and a few loss of about 50 thousand dead, we managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of the society.
And the devastation of the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted to do a lot of other women, rebuild the civil society -- <unk> a dedicated transition to democracy and national connection.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> for, and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about developing capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the Women's Women's Women -- <unk> by the <unk> a women's movement, which to advocate for the Tunisian transfer of woman and for our right to participate in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the menstrual period, an environment that was getting more <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, <unk> the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day in the news of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> from mosques old and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their promises of the human rights violations.
Our society, made it for a competitive mindset -- and it has been away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had to the beginning.
The <unk> the <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here at all of us at all, with our success story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I'm here today to say that we, as nation, choosing bad, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the election didn't get peace, stability and security and security.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and candidate brought peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> as much as men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not just women, but women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus on the most of what the election needed to do is just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the performance of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> representation and we used to do it.
We need to stop acting like an outrage agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting like compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but also putting the mercy in practice, but it is also putting the mercy of <unk> instead of the competition, the collaboration instead of <unk>
These are the ideal that a Libya, <unk> by the war, desperately desperately need to reach the end of the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and the male <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in a existential way before we make it <unk>
According to the <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> that is known in all the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic, that the word <unk> <unk> feminine <unk> to the entire humanity of men and women, where all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so, like the uterus covers completely <unk> that grows inside, the extreme matrix of compassion -- the top existence.
This is how "My mercy is <unk> all the things."
And so he says, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
They are all given the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a reasonable question that has an answer as a matter of it.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to tackle is the one that everybody makes for me, why is that is left?
Why was anyone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, not a social worker, or an expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as an author and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, the man, that I creates my alma mater, me, <unk> my head with a <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, he loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap. <unk> of love, where each year millions of women, and even some men.
Until his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working on the hospital companies -- <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the races, all religions, all of the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in relationships of <unk> <unk> and long duration or, in the families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> reason why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would sit with a man who would stick with it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year for couples, and <unk> and husbands -- in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in the subway in New York City and started to <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a university of the <unk> <unk> and he worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most of that first encounter was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk> guy.
He had big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially in the beginning of a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me, which I was ready, I had gone to Harvard, I had a passion to help girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why the degree at that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any of the domestic violence relationship is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go out of New York and quit the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I said, "I left my job and <unk> and I went into Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering head in a physical, financial trap carefully <unk>
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you were supposed to be so safe to feel so safe it bought three <unk>
One had in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept under the pillow of our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to cause the trauma to come from small.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I had never lifted my hand, my life already was serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend suit from my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were happy to live happily forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
There were simply very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they would form a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I never would be hurt anymore.
I spent twice the top of our honey.
And the first time I was driving into a secret beach and he <unk> and he brought me so strong in my head that <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon. It was <unk> by traffic and threw a Big Mac Mac to the face.
<unk> he kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was scared when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in his life, and the Center for Disease Control that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So I actually had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was using me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to deal with their <unk>
The other question everybody does is: Why don't you just not get <unk>
Why did I not <unk> I could have gone anywhere.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people -- because we have the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the domestic violence pattern is to kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has finally put the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Others include permanent harassment with permanent harassment -- even after the <unk> has become married, they would have a financial resources, and manipulation of the family judicial system to encourage the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not to be able to get the man to get their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it is just not going.
I was able to <unk> because of the last <unk> beat up my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody about the world -- to the police, to my neighbors, to my friends and family friends, all across strangers, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like <unk> women -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people this is a way to say "The fault is it by <unk> as if the victims were <unk> deliberately <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a systematic lesson from what happened to them and that <unk> their lives joyful and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor.
I came back to marry a young man and kind of kind and these three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to ever have more, is a gun gun pointing to my head in somebody who says he wants to it.
At this moment, just like you're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> how stupid you <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people that are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they are <unk> or that they are <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting their daughter, your sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Violence is only based on silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need around the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of light talking about it with their children, their peers, their friends and family.
<unk> their view of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
They put the very distinctive signs of violence to get consciously, to slow their climbing and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the historic oasis and convince them that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment, there's an awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have any like this.  Luckily, I brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first job of clothing in a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they die, they don't have to be <unk> now, but to find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about about 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These two-inch heel. I don't have to use it.
The worst part is to move this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so I don't do anything while I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but we also <unk>
I have totally changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he would take my back and get her back into the hair of the child.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like that I asked me two days for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our look, which, even though the shallow surface and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, will be brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> -- but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape to <unk> and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage of the heritage that I've known to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the public who now shows <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk> -- there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing both models.
But sadly, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York -- I told all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- is less than four percent, they were not white.
So the next question that people are always asking me is: can it be model when you look different.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But after that, what I would really tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first one.
If after this first list is still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, so I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> <unk> magazine or the next Steven <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that more you want to be model is to say you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you should choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you run your studies, and you have a copy and you have a copy of your back, no matter what you want, you know, if you <unk> that you want to be president of the United States, but you have a Model Model of inner clothing for 10 years, people would look at you <unk>
The next question that people always do is whether all of the photos are <unk>
And yeah, they were pretty much <unk> all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I was told, and I was also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal ground, but it was a girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in the V.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> of a team of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people from <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is to do things for free?
I have too many five-minute heel. I have never use, except the previous couple -- but the privilege I get to be the ones I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to bring money, and they gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped up a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, an agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> from these privileges <unk> for my look, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for what it looks like, whatever they are.
I live in New York City, and the year of the <unk> teenagers who were killed, and <unk> 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there's only <unk> young black and Latino young people in New York City, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
I think about how many times <unk>
When I research this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the girls of 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit less <unk> and you have the smartest hair, you'll feel very happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative people, clever and <unk>
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my mind every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a bunch of models, because they have the most embarrassing legs -- the brightest hair and the <unk> but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that will retain from this talk, I hope that you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was to follow a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I didn't go to my <unk>
There were no directors and no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a little bit of care in lighting.
In fact, most people were taken random tourists at random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me up this picture holding my daughter on his first day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five.
I happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take you to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
This is when we start to ask for the tourists that they would get to do the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that a five-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time at a week of October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we took the same picture, our perspective changes, my <unk> <unk> new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives and interacts with everything.
That time in concrete we spent together is something we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, on one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the rubber store, which came from small on previous visits
And he described to me what had felt about five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that reminded its heart <unk> with strength to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 pictures, I don't leave in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls up the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you didn't get to go close to someone and ask him, take a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter as a silly <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the press. laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with the Parliament <unk> but I don't accept.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment the environment --  <unk> don't help prevent disease <unk>
They're hardly <unk>   And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World who found primarily in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the second, where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are they going to be important are important? First of all, they provide vital ecological services.
They're our <unk>
They would take the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria. They help to absorb anthrax that would not be because it would spread out and cause great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times in <unk> and this has tremendous ramifications of spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of protective and maternity and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the fifth and the Under Egypt.
In the mythology -- <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the next 10 heads <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do a very important set of <unk> to open sky in places like <unk> there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there is conflicts between humans and <unk> communities using this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of <unk> -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey to the livestock consumption that's been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for prison in India and they've taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs have a huge pump of time to <unk> The number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the greatest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from the Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds.
They're <unk> birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds.
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so I can focus on a locally new problem that's not going to do anything.
We have to work with governments in the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion of opinion because he watched it fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Each thing I do and everything that I do, my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia. Kenya, Costa from <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGOs and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Rather than that, everything that you did, you know?
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where some Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we got to the seeds of <unk> to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local <unk> tomatoes and Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all who were interested in doing that, so I would encourage them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't get to <unk>  We were just in the way that local <unk> in so fertile valley, had had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't do anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here   <unk> time to save the people from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red at night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you answer it? You never get <unk>
I thought that only of us were going to make any mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what the hell they were doing, and what they were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk> --  <unk> seeing the waste that we gave to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the harm we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But it means two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture like my kids, "I want a lot."
I'm trying to deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
That's why the white ones in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- the little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put up on the floor, and he said, "We can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years just respond to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you have never motivates anybody, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have sleep to become a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It never comes into a community with an idea, and it sits with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a pub.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what do you do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important.
And so we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why don't they do it, for once, but not in community meetings.
I'm going to tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never cried and they will never be told, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So planning has this blind place.
The most intelligent people in their community, you don't even know them, because they're not attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family physician in the company, the family physician is a family physician in the business table, and it sets up with you in your home, at your kitchen table -- in your kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city in Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this <unk> garbage where we came to tell you what to do.
Within a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something really, really difficult.
And so I was <unk>   So --   So the government says, "We <unk> <unk>  We've done it on 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business experts in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before being involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the spirit of the spirit.
So now we're talking to rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to be <unk> privacy, it has to be great to the aid, and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
So what are you going to talk about is tomorrow tomorrow?
People <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution will not renewable energy, <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a great story that was in a theoretical magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the course of the year -- he gathered this group of people -- and I salute what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York had not been, within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population stays growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? <unk> in the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States -- <unk> off-the-shelf companies <unk>
And the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few days -- <unk> factories in places like this.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer <unk>
Otherwise, it won't come to talk to you.
Then, you have to offer an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then you've got to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The youngest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three <unk> things, the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, selling and looking for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This was not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 icons in the world -- <unk> <unk> Ford, all new companies Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one, no one was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment -- in <unk> along with their dedicated dedicated business -- who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> somebody who talks to you, what does it need?
What can you do? Can you do that?
Well, you can <unk> you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
People around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't understand a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and request more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do you share more of our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect on our own and dream needs.
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that they take shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
And it always comes across the music.  There is a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the largest American <unk>
I live close to this house and I thought how I could turn it into a better space for the neighborhood, and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden <unk>
I thought a lot about death and so much.
And this was a profound gratitude for the time lived and lived for time.
I gave it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I would be able to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to catch the day and forget how important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this <unk> house on a giant board and he painted about it sentences for <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before she died, I want to be trial on <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit on the <unk> line of <unk>
"Before she died, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
"Before she died, I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before she died, I want to give you once more."
"Before I die I want to go rescue <unk>
"Before she died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space has become <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving the reflection of the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues from the civic center, we made a kit and now they've done walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions in the increase, it's more important than ever, to find ways of conserving the perspective and remembering that life is short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even to think, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that we make more power.
It's going to be thinking about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than individuals and as community and with more media to share hope and stories, the people around us -- not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
They don't talk about, but it gives you joy better than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
You share it <unk> pass what's happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter to religious differences and look at this: has never been <unk>
When they sing songs from our childhood, trying to say the words that I couldn't even believe -- it reminds me of one thing: the little thing that we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel she's 16 years old. It's high. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but he remembers the year when I came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would think of my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the birthday of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like that?
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although not consider it inside of it, it could only mean one thing: they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary people.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In every single individual and it manifests itself in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, are being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of the development that faster in the world, there is no cause no known choice.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new way to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
I lived in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure on the smallest things, like putting the cars around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that there was <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments where I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that these are things that wouldn't want to change by the normal.
History is by high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could give it a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift in their interior and honestly, the pursuit of normal, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the U.S.
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher to give a kind of communication to graduate students.
I was scared.  <unk> real <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their big unknown books.
But in the developing of those conversations, I felt what I had felt must have felt when he fell through the <unk> <unk> and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges and health care, among other people, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we didn't have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their whole world.
So scientists and engineers, please take <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and that your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us just to study the <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, caring with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of its ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that making them silly it.
On the contrary, as Einstein, which is all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One of the things to consider is to use examples, and analogies. They are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when you present your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they call <unk>  What do you do? The bullets killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's <unk> too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the Eiffel Tower, <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then to give you graphs that encourage our other senses, and they create a deeper sense of understanding of what they get.
I think these are just some key key that you can help the other open door and look at the country of wonders which is science and engineering.
And so, scientists, and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all over the media, put it with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English words is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor in the 19th century that defined it a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for a public charge -- no matter of it, and that when he wins, and when he wins, gets it for the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One of the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It was not <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to <unk> the exact words that they were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the first name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They put her in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had a popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's true.
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to tackle the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all sorts of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was proven to be done.
And not even with it -- they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given time.
And there might be <unk>
All the world got tired of me, because this debate would fall over for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper.
What caused the <unk> and <unk> House was against the <unk>
The House House didn't want that Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call him King for whether he gave him or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> and more unfortunate title that you had happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. It was no longer before, but it only meant <unk> who would be <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "Is it ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet <unk> <unk>
"And who will be serious with a <unk> title like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one, until I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as a President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting to be the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we will keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is most important, and with this -- I want to tell you, is that the title of President of America does not sound so modest today in the day, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear <unk> the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have fortune to the title of <unk>
So at the end he won the <unk>
Do you get your title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, look like, well, it was a uniqueness at the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything is because they want to sound like the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them they are now the president of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and what I would like to do is <unk>
Now, politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually actually changes a lot more the words that what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 at the ground under the ground in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is burst of heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak about but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and rocks with tools.
Like others, I carry a cheap drink of light -- he holds my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the land.
He <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> I met the control and dropped countless feet into that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep part of that hole at risk to risk their lives without pays a reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they may never be able to be prey in slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents in six continents in six continents and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the G8 <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who has to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was no longer grade.
When we ended up talking to me about I was very sad, I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me angry. And weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African Africans for all about slave slave people.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, you can provide entire families for generations per generations per generations from 18.
Surprisingly, slavery generates profit from over <unk> billion a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promise of good education and better work to find that they are forced to work without pay, under violence threat and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce are disposable are long.
The slavery exists in most of the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick <unk>
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, kids, in fact, entire families -- entire families in a heavy canopy canopy -- <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no staff to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it to pee out pretty <unk>
And so <unk> was the heat and the powder that my camera became too hot and then I left it working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I thought my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side to me, just grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizenship of that country.
I could put them in an worse situation than they already were.
I had to rely on the <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and he trusted him to <unk>
As to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids carrying rocks for miles through <unk> terrain to trucks down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who <unk> and the kids would put them into their heads of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
Do you have nothing to <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> completely home.
When you hear the word slavery as we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global awareness that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously been <unk> sex.
I was driven by a few <unk> <unk> who gave this same <unk> <unk> of florescent light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local in forced prostitution of forced prostitution.
They have small, private rooms, where they sell them with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- they're forced to entertain customers and to help them buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember feeling a <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be stuck in that hell.
I only had a <unk> on the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows like to get it out.
Those people don't have <unk> and, since we touch a hard subject -- it's important to point out that slavery even sexual traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of people in the agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 Americans are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often related to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a portrait of family.
The black hands of black are the father, and the blue <unk> of the blue and the red <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My performer told me about his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, yet be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we actually pay us our job."
It is estimated that there are over 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest <unk> lake in the world.
When we got there, I went down a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a community of fishermen on a boat, two older siblings, some younger kids -- makes sense of it.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families and <unk> and forced to work with a lot of <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to come up there -- I was <unk> a little bit of a canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The <unk> branches of trees submerged in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, and fear, you get the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and like all of life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it's about the most young slaves under their seat.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one another.
It was cold and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh more than 400 kilos when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
He would spread out by a road in Ghana with <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their bike.
We were asked to do it by a road road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to go out of the car, and he asked the driver's driver to come back quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we took away the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of my head on my head as I went through these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and everyone was full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children strapped to their backs, and while they were looking at gold, <unk> in <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 meters, and these people carry together heavy stone bags which will then be <unk> to another area where they would put the stone to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the margin we see to work at least fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for two-thirds in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in mines.
When he died their uncle, <unk> I took the debt of the uncle that will be a slave of the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines 14, and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet that's forced to work night and day on that mine.
And yet, he dream to be liberated and educated with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of head of face to a remote, <unk> which inspires me a lot respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to be testimony to them and that we'll do everything that we can to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as humans, then it makes a very difficult <unk> <unk>
These images are not old. They're people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that happens that I don't think about these beautiful beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images give up a force in which you see, in people like you, and I hope that force will turn out a fire and that <unk> light on slavery on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math and there's a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like management agencies.
Nobody knows what the hell do we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the more human activities.
We dislike the <unk> of dancer and the dancers of <unk> --  -- that we'll see later on.
But identifying a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill, and probably a certain <unk> <unk> who can well have a genetic <unk>
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a virtuous ballet survivor.
In the last few years, it's been a lot of progress in treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is really a cure when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it is frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are no <unk> <unk> so they don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of the clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would be a trip to the clinic. What if patients could get the exam to ourselves?
It doesn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is to you about to you as conventional for a try, in a sense, in a sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the <unk>
It shows someone very healthy while it emits some of the <unk> to speak, and we can imagine it as a dancers of a singing <unk> because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds, and we all have the necessary gene -- the <unk> for example.
And as they did, it requires an extraordinary training.
Take a child to learn how to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as it <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the limbs, also affects the <unk>
On the bottom line, you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of the strings in the bottom.
We see the same <unk>
Lee <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more peaceful and malnutrition after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they are both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> Both of them use existing infrastructure.
It's not necessary to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both accurate. All right, but also <unk> exams are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very rapidly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're very minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes such a <unk> cost appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the problems of the patients.
I don't do need to go to the clinic to capture routine.
Ultimately, we could get <unk> data.
We could make it massive <unk> for a massive trial for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we are launching the <unk> Initiative.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these goals.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or <unk> I can call it at low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, like, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What will it take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What's going on is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not the disease or not the disease of course.
<unk> You see, some people can not afford it, you may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion in pursuit of real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have an precision <unk> at this time?
It's a lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has made a fantastic job, and now it's shown that it works on the mobile phone network, well, what you would do -- the project -- now we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of the 2011, I made <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We lie in the dark, in rooms without windows and generally we avoid sunlight.
We do the chemical models still more <unk> the perfect skin is still more <unk> we can make it possible for the press all of the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for the images and photography.
On March 11, in 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the events that were going on in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where it was <unk> there, <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded more than 24 feet tall and over three kilometers inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
We have rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> <unk> We took the slime off and left the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish dead -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> us and they loved it.
For weeks, so many volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and drawings and cameras and cards.
Everyone did the same thing.
Let's take them to different places around the villages around us to get them up.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk> people.
I helped clean toilets and open bathrooms -- gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be a place in the village where the <unk> center, they pick up the photos.
And I had the honor there and I had the honor of that day to <unk> to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard about the expression of thinking beyond <unk> but it wasn't until it was going to get my horizons my horizons that something happened.
When I look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to do with a lot of precision and <unk>
In other words, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as you have the <unk> picture.
Over the time of time, they got a little bit more photos and it took more <unk> so that I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries offered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, we will join us to <unk> a village to Northern <unk>
Once in the week we use our scanner in the temporary agencies that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could be <unk>
It could be a couple of months.
This <unk> had to draw a little bit of hand using a guide to the areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these photos as long as all these pictures would take in all of bacteria, with algae -- even with oil, all of it along with the time I still continue to see -- that's a major part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless it was clean clean -- and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with the <unk>
We have a <unk> of <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more photos even <unk>
As once he once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these photos were lucky in relation to the photos.
He had started to <unk> her but she stopped to realize that the <unk> even further.
It also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been able to <unk> the images in a single photo and put the whole picture.
When I picked his photos he shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble very far from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would have it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Your young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
She took a week to find his entire family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his photos his little son of 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could see -- something that he could look back to look, something that would remember from the past that he would not have been labeled by that day again when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there and there were hundreds of them helped us clean up the other hand of <unk> -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority went back to the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us give back to 90 hundred families -- totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more than <unk> on teams and materials and most materials, most ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They're <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would bring but the first thing to look for.
So this was the project to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone back to someone who was going to move into the past.
When a photograph like this comes back to somebody, it is a huge difference in the life of the person who <unk>
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger -- to give something bigger -- using your talent to something that won't be biological models of perfect skin.
To finish the end of this email. I would like to read this electronic email -- I sent him the day from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't help but think about people and stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a picture with women from the grandmother to the young girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> around a baby, and my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my newly <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition just a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but to a billion frames per second.
Let me introduce you to a new kind of <unk> a new technique that can create videos on a slow motion of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> of the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I will turn it on and put it up in a second <unk> or a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just one millimeter as well.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet as a commons.
If we took that bullet and this <unk> package and <unk> in this bottle, how they spread out that photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   remember, all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --      -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes in the bottle with a photons package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, start <unk>
And part of the light <unk> goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble flowing inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel along the table and because of the reflections of the top of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a regular and current bullet and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it on slow down about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to look at that movie?
One day? A week? Actually, every year.
It would be a very boring movie --  -- on motion.
What about <unk> nature <unk>
You can see the waves of the table, the tomato <unk> and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I was thinking about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a <unk> composition of course.
But if you look at this arm, you'll realize that, as the light gets rid of the tomato sauce, it is <unk>
Why? Because the tomato <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell -- they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown up without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers, you know, if you take a photo on the bottom exhibition, it goes very little light into it.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so you can barely get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded again and again with a very elaborate <unk> we took these <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of these data in the raw data, in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a peaceful future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door on the room, you will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And we could extract these multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, there is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons come back to the camera -- but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capabilities.
It has very good resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also even the hidden objects but we don't know what point it is to be aware of.
As a laser project you can record a picture in <unk> that you see on the screen, it doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of pictures, and we're going to try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's around the way around the curve, the curve, right?
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body -- <unk> <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, of course, because of tissue and blood is pretty hard, so actually this is a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
So like <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, it became the science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
And I realized that all the <unk> data that we collected every time are not just for scientific visualizations but we can see.
And to create a new form of computational photography with slow motion and code code.
And look at those waves -- remember, time between each one of those waves is just about <unk>
But here also happens to be fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> they go away from us.
<unk> should move towards us.
What happens here?
And it turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which events occur in the world sometimes appear to focus on the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, can we fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.

I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people would go to search for change.
This is the fall of 1989. So imagine if all of these people gathering that <unk> to look for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who of the lights have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking about my mobile phone, and how my life changed.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information that is there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. filed a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every single telephone company, every vendor on all of Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to whom.
Who sent a text to whom.
And if we use cell phone, where do we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and even two years, in his phone company or their <unk>
And all of these people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this observation of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone providers and the Internet providers -- all of this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some people even said that this would be <unk> Vietnam.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany, as well.
And I also asked if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that at the time was the largest telephone company in Germany, for favor of all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to wonder, and I didn't get a concrete response. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to have a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end of the end, he agreed.
They put the demand and they sent me the information that I would <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> and five thousand information lines.
I looked at them and I said, well, it's a huge archive right.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
Was it a little bit, what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a 30-year visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and <unk> go back and forward.
You can see every step I want to see.
And you can see how I go from <unk> in train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call me each other.
And then you call the other, and we end up with this big communications network.
You can see how people communicate with each other, what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sent an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and even two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither is the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to drive them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not in fashion.
When you go home, you go back to the representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I've got cerebral palsy, and that's why they would take all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, even though they are.
It's just by accidents, like the one I got at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not an inspiration.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, I wish I would be disabled.
Let's take a walk.
Christmas Christmas, are in the shopping center, they drive in circles looking for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
They think, "God, I can be at least a little <unk>
In addition, I have no 99 problems, and the P. <unk> is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslims and female, living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I would always love my neighborhood, and my disease had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I can do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe when you don't meet.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters were going to go to public school, my parents went to the school system and <unk> that I also went, and if I didn't get rid of all the ultimate note -- all of my mother's <unk>
My father taught me how to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to get it to you.
The <unk> I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the children of my children walked as a fan champion that has gotten many taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they remain all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that they died during the <unk>
I would tell them that it had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> at dusk is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so I was sent to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I would too.
And when my friends came to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I was going on my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would become <unk>
In summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I would drink milk from <unk> and put me out of warm cups on my back, and I would lie in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes, and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the thrust cure yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before I was doing yoga was a comedian of <unk> that he couldn't stand up, <unk>
And now I can <unk> in my head.
My parents would argue this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater department.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least, I took the ultimate note into my students, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the Coast zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a piece called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy
I was a girl with cerebral palsy
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "The order will have a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of the end.
Thank God <unk> at the end of me <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater, crying and historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask him why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the game scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do any risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that he was literally born and gave it to an actor without cerebral palsy
The university was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
At <unk> I went home, and my first tour, was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was evident to me that directors, directors, not <unk> <unk> <unk> not white, with disabilities.
Just to make perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, he took celebrity celebrity in New Jersey, to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he was at the high speed of the New Jersey New Jersey with a driver that had <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know I know you never heard that little unpleasant buzz that says women aren't fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the New York Festival from New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and eventually remind them of the business directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to the Arab was much easier than to fight the challenge of stigma <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the news program on the wire, it has Keith <unk>
I went in like a graduate dance if I went to a graduate dance, I went to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to the bank desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was kind of like <unk> and pasted my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
They say that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me and a girl and older than any older man.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I would see I'd see clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What does it have?
We should really pray for her."
A reviewer suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with the media, but I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We may still use the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I arrived at <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in a representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> the children of <unk> a charity to give young refugees in a very much part of what my parents would love me.
It was the only time my father saw me becoming alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know your story.
She lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the little village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there is no opportunity, there is no work, no perspectives in future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you read about a gentleman that gives him him to <unk> after dinner to dinner <unk>
It would give a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home.
I show you a young lady.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb car.
That little boy in that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist, and that dynamic group of people were in the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how the story of a young village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, hoping to start a future, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that made it out of what we call the <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of opportunity, of jobs, but the young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities -- the story of the <unk> history -- the access to terrorism, to terrorism, to <unk> to be the history of cities.
And in my hometown of born, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit At <unk> Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in the hospital in the hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I'd been forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders at a point.
<unk> to a few juvenile juvenile leaders.
We sat down and had an rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a college college unemployed, frustrated, was the perfect black for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to be <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
She started a <unk> company.
She started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit and I think the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so often.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until recently, until he arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of those who grew up in the civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
She started a company of <unk> and design design.
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they might survive the hard <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for him, creating gardens in the homes, and the city companies and the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGOs working for the government, but their history, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
We have business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people to create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their own reality.
They need expertise and orientation for <unk> in the development and put out of their business.
They encourage young people with the resources they need, <unk> the support they need to move from understanding to creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something else to start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park in the <unk> this is how it's called, when it is created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> he hired the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation, and they'll have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace that <unk> and <unk> from <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> Mountains in the <unk> area of New York state.
It was a beautiful day.
<unk> forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it will not be on the way that we were able to pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed on a <unk> Lake <unk> <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square feet with <unk> apple balls, and <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to pull out what they thought I was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and he was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where do you get the <unk> where you clean our trash into <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
So here in New York City, the Department of <unk> clean our trash at 11 tons of waste and two tons of products -- every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their routes and I interviewed people in offices and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go a lot more.
So I started working with trash.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And operated the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong you will be <unk>
It costs a lot of us to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of carrying on their body tons of trash every day.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor <unk> the collection of waste is one of the top ten <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass around around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the relentless trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It always has to be moving.
And it's the stigma.
It seems that stigma is particularly ironic because I think that the <unk> of waste is the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective way every day, this begins to take away from their containers and their dangers inherent to us in very real forms.
We had <unk> for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have room for what the economy is going to begin to fail when it's at danger when it's in danger is <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointing your relationship.
And then there is what I call our average average rate necessary.
And so I mean just how much the way that used to be used by moving in the time <unk>
We don't really have any <unk> or <unk> or we carry with us our coffee cup, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that it takes for it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about harvesting waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and engage in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day in the street every day.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do our work on.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us against ourselves, from our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow always must stay in one way or another.
And one day after the 11th of September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of waste in the street, I grabbed my little baby stairs and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing this particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started looking at waste and I went back to this man.
It's called <unk> we worked together a lot of times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have in account all the costs, even the very human cost of the labor of labor.
The city waste -- what we think when we talk about garbage represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic of <unk>
So in the flow of their days and in your life, the next thing to see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to get it.
Let me give you a moment to tell you much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives will become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that we showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we needed to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city that we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> of <unk> generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate weather that's going from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And third, it looks like nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a worth of a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually <unk> with the old market that's this structure in the open air where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There also is that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a building in a number of stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to identify the website, which is located in a much growth zone, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two street streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, uniting all the entries from the building.
And this extends into a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the open air in the building that would be used by its own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes on every floor because of the shape of space.
I also thought, how close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the rise of the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model <unk>
We are building that with these little pieces of pieces of the windows that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors crystals that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center.
But we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because in order to have more local people to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was significantly more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting it into the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this city oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which set out water to the sanitation of the inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big project, the biggest that I'm alive, needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I had special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve <unk> doors of almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was we scaled up the streets in the streets -- creating 12 very similar blocks of similar and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities from Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some of the <unk> of the <unk> to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this has altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell in the project, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So you know, <unk> a scheme to make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant, we have all the connections to pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set a greater density in the upper levels and a lower density in the ground plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community to the community that was busy construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and get up and do activities like running a race of two miles in the morning, or jump out of one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people change communities and local economies at the same pace that buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair, very bright hair <unk> nice <unk> nice <unk> -- nice <unk> -- very good for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I took my sinister plan.
I got a time after the age of school. I was a little bit later, and I was stuck in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's at grades.
And then, I did.
I'm going to go through the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit of a few.
All the like --  And I signed up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all of the rows of <unk> and myself a row of that, just by being there, because I would <unk>
I'm still surprising to what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's all obvious <unk>
I will never be surprised.
But above all, I was given the reason why I was bothered by this little little girl, so small, it was so good for <unk>
I was overwhelmed with jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also primates. <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause one in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that we observe loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab in which you study <unk> in all of its possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it is an exaggeration to say that if there was no compassion."
Well, there would be no longer because it would have no <unk>
There is no <unk> King and <unk>
There is no Shakespeare.
They would take the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost you have all of them.
This year, they get a hundred years of their masterpiece, "In looking for the <unk> study in the sexual <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> my God, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk>
We forgot how hard this image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as a cat.
I don't know what the cat, <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious because the jealousy, which is reduced to the person, to your wish, to their <unk> are a very good <unk>
I don't know. I think we get too close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about people's lives of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being the storytellers and the audience, we know exactly what little details I was going to <unk> the knife is, right?
<unk> make us all of novelists <unk> and that's something I understood understood understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure I could give you pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover adds to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it an extraordinary emotion, you have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> of the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like great amounts of hair, bright hair and beautiful <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --   <unk> links well <unk> language with the jealousy.
When you <unk> it is in his <unk> agony of soon listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're finding knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, <unk> <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to need us, that causes us to cause us to cause us a much deeper array of feelings and vital than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> give us ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, our <unk> ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who was being used with the idea that his woman was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, who didn't get stuck in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
novels described very well how <unk> are doing to look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, in fact, we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are bringing us to violent or illegal acts.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself in the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman from Michigan was just captured by having created a false account on Facebook since he would send <unk> messages to himself, for a year.
For a year -- every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge even though we do creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like an Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who deal with how the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanted what you have to spread from your being and <unk> what you ever want, and it's under the floor -- you're going your name, it takes your rings, you get your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you the rest of the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in the time of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and asked for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> on Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always won <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but he bothers him.
Oh, my mind sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with their solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We are not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't like to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> it was in the history -- I think this is really emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as an geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're the same side.
Suddenly, you can admire that idea of being <unk>
Could it even be so simple?
What if <unk> really is a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like the plans of <unk>
So as we expect that to happen, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction fiction jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> the invites to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the <unk> Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21st of July Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> on the Apollo Day, 11 and killed over the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were themselves, but their presence in the surface of the surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the most mobilization for peace in U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave it work to about 400,000 people and asked for 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo <unk>
But before the Apollo program took 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> <unk> over its surface, from which the Armstrong after Armstrong died, is now the most <unk>
So why is it <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> 350 pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that the Kennedy Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words from Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why is it <unk>
Why do it turn into our goal?
And they might also ask, why is it going to scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly over the <unk>
Why does it play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was the point in front of the powers of technology.
It was because it was really great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology's technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it <unk> the <unk> and it was eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle <unk> but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 40,000 miles <unk>
Since the 1970s, no human being has come to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism bug about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagined the technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't go to the escape exhaust.
I knew so many that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that knows about our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard that all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists have got caught with us, and they had enriched toys with trivial, things like <unk> and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But we didn't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an explanation in the Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies that <unk> from the years when they were <unk> <unk> Microsoft, and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically, incentives that risk capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas -- by funding <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, small investment, small investment investment that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with profit in technologies like energy, which need tremendous capital and whose development is in the long run, has never invested in development of technologies that are dedicated to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and deep.
Sometimes we chose not to solve big problems.
You could go to Mars if you were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going on Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative power sources that are able to compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree on which policies and international treaties <unk> the development of a <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy or international treaties who reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological, they turn out not to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure in the food process.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and food systems, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon Nixon was telling him the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many types of cancer -- some extremely resistant to treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can have and must, but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it has to be a <unk> problem, and we have to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, does it happen with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no competition like in the Cold War, there's no politician in the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how difficult and dangerous, and there is no popular science of science fiction as we explore the solar system.
In general, go to the moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a big decline of trust, it's a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should get the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about that.
First <unk> why people think confidence has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I turn to think that it might have dropped in some activities, or institutions that could have grown up in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to medical polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they still remain pretty reliable for nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway through.
But that's enough?
Which opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people are doing when they make certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
They were in the <unk> teachers.
He probably would be asked by asking, "What to do what?"
And that would be very <unk>
And you might say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust you in some other not."
It's very rational.
In short, in real life, we tend to deposit the confidence in the form of <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> or a person or a person who is going to be uniform at all of them.
I could, for example, I would say I trust a certain English teacher that I know to give the class of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in the more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real trust level -- because they try to attract the good inherent judgment of the fact to trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think that's stupid.
That's not the goal that I want.
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
In short, I'm <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who are taking their savings with the very rightly named Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you just say, it says, yes, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is doing a judgment of how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust her, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they are not responsible.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see it <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is like this, I haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're interested in, right before trust.
Trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we have tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, and officials and others -- that made us easier to judge their reliability.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like this."
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to do the cynical <unk> that will attend <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and I think that the accountability system that is meant to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> is actually making the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You probably all know similar examples.
And so we got all of that, for the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they are trying to be worthy of trust and encourage people to be reliable and whether other people to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple, simple, <unk> what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> to the task to rebuild trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But the trust, in short, is defining because we give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the basis for enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to provide <unk> that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That goes on every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a single commercial example.
The grocery store where I buy my socks on it says I can give them them without giving explanations more.
I take them and get the money back, or they change the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other side, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the early computers, we have been able to become <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that imagination can be <unk>
And this separation has been increasingly gone and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started to imagine what it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that <unk> in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
The designers can get their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice in virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool the barriers.
But the two hands stay out of the screen.
How can you get inside and interact with digital information using all the <unk>
In the Science of Microsoft, I joined the Microsoft, and my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a <unk> digital field.
They <unk> a spinal cord with depth of depth in order to detect your fingers and the face, you can actually lift your hands out of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and to highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down on every floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we type in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
We have a lot of us to bought and explore things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would you be a future like that?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical pixel physicist.
This magnet, <unk> as a pixel pixel in space, which means that both the computer like users can move the object anywhere in this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> metal and <unk>
And to program the object, we release it from the time constraints and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
And you can teach them physically and a distance and the famous distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can reproduce as a physical reality of the time that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike monitors or textbooks, this is a real experience and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world around us without having to take care of our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only limit you have is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to invite a school to athletes all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After they survive the Islamic Revolution, they firmly believed that there was just an effective path to <unk> a safe and <unk> work.
No matter if the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer in my mind.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start to <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio program.
But no adult the idea.
No adult got me seriously.
Only my friends got married, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much bigger to train.
My dream would never be <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class is the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
Get the books.
<unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> Echo <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to America in 1995, and what were the first books that were going here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> about Chinese life.
And it is not a <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to me, "It's so different, and so much better than it <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also took place to my reading <unk>
<unk> lots of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
Real reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparative religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the Christ, <unk> are economic effective, politically and <unk>
For Abraham is all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
On the path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me up a magic door to connect with people from the past and present.
I know it won't be feeling alone or powerless actually.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I have come to believe the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Your most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
Until a broken dream, I can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client for <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called Alex.
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a prime <unk> put on my office on my office taken off the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My colleague had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy to move my head while they would get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> and what I saw was, she was right.
You start working after, you start working on, you get kids later, even the death goes on.
To <unk> like Alex and I had time to get over.
But shortly after, my squad <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Sure, he's coming up with guys under your category, <unk> with a <unk> head -- but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe they <unk> on the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before he <unk>
This is what psychologists call <unk>
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yeah, people feel head after what they do, but this didn't cause the <unk> of Alex to be a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem, and I had real consequences and not only to Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future <unk>
There are 50 million people in the United States, today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody comes to age old without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes!
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> remove the dream of a <unk> and I want to see. It's okay.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be at 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that shape their life would have happened to when they have 30 and <unk>
People from over 40, you don't go to panic.
This audience is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that <unk>
We know more than half of the Americans are married, or they are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and they are <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that wants to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than anywhere else in life, and we know that female fertility comes to her top to 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to take care of their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where its everyday life and common has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what people are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the time of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
<unk> would give them names, names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, all of the smart people like you or your children and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count, I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "All saying that while I start a career before all the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day that I graduated from college school.
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the play game.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and everybody started to sit around.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of extreme stuff, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a career, choose a city, pick a partner, and have two or three children in a much shorter period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's a research that starts to show, which is much more difficult and really <unk> to do everything back to the <unk>
The middle-aged age crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want to now.
He says you can't have the son you want to do, or you can't give her a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the people are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
The 25, Emma came to my office because he was in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite a very hard time -- very difficult life earlier had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our sessions, but then you get up her same way to say, "One doesn't pick your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, her day Emma came his head on his legs and <unk> for almost all the hour.
I just had to buy a new book book for him, and I had just spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he got watching the empty space that follows the words -- "For emergency case, please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who will be for me if I have an accident <unk>
Who is going to take care of me if it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was really <unk>
She needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex and just sitting in the <unk> of Emma going on the front.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or female, deserves to know.
First of all, I told her Emma who was <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> of identity.
For identity capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not count, that by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma I was going to get jobs and make it back.
Secondly, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are excellent to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with friends with similar minds are limited to who you know, how they think, how they think, how they do, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person with whom are going to get out of the time it comes out of their nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak bonds friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half won't, and the weak bonds are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the world's jobs have never been <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a <unk>
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know to your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as she was growing up, she's going to take her family when she has a partner and form her own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose her family had come.
You might think that 30 is better at the way that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choice to the person you live now, or you're going to fall away, now when everyone on Facebook start walking towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be so <unk> in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be aware of who and what you want to do instead of just making it work or killing time with anyone who will encourage you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link, helped him get a work there.
That offer of work gave a reason to leave the boyfriend that I live alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
He <unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not <unk>
The story of Emma Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes coming out of Los Angeles, and they go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light bulb makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea worth spreading all of the people who heard of.
It's as simple as I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma all the <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your identity capital, using their weak ties.
Don't be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in management <unk> for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to <unk> students in New New York City schools.
And as any teacher, you know, tests and tests.
I do tasks.
When I work it would go back, save grades.
What struck me the attention was that <unk> wasn't the only difference between my best students, and my worst students.
Some of them who had better performance had no <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest children weren't going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and so convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to conclude that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a psychological perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a fast way and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> <unk> and in every study, my question was, who has a success here and why?
My research team and I went to the British Academy <unk> West <unk>
We are trying to predict what they were going to do -- in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children we would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in neighborhoods, really hard neighborhoods, what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year and <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the learning results of their <unk>
We associate with private companies, ask people, which of these marketers are going to keep their own <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts arose a feature as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health and not <unk>
It was the <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to reach very long goals.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> no career at all.
A few years ago, I started to study the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my questionnaires <unk> and then I waited about more than a year to see who was <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination to be significantly greater likely to <unk> even when we collide them in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of testing testing even safety they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only on West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where it matters <unk> also in school, especially for the children of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, the little bit of the science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you development determination in the kids?
What should I do to teach kids a robust ethical <unk>
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are just not going on with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the sensitivity is commonly related or even related to violence to talent measurements.
Until now, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk> of growth."
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and they learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mentality is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to start to fail, to start all over new with the lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I would spread out this incredible language.
But for a foreigner, it seems to be so <unk> like the Great <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that whoever is to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be helpful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every single character from every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
So we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and easy way.
A Chinese academic scholar -- 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy of religion.
The first 200 will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read signals from <unk> menus to understand the basic idea of the web or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were crying out -- this symbol is actually <unk> in the shape of the called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so they think many more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks behind, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a hundred are a crowd.
If a person stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a prisoner as a <unk> in the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Hold a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> from remember, because a speaker is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two sides -- it becomes very hot.
Three sides -- that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon bright together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. You put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> had someone at home?
This person is coming out of an door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, are <unk>
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
When you use this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started making sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
And we know that Japan is the land of the Sun.
This is a sun put up with first, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to us, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
An Japanese person.
The character on the left are two <unk> stacked one on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese Chinese <unk> their enemy enemies of the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to get out of a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and go down the stage.
What I prefer to be about being the films that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film mastered its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand to it.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial fantasy shows a child's painting.
Yet the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
That trend actually took over 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> boy would put a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the magician in Oz and all the films that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk>
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the military generated by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one thing in the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did see Star Wars <unk> a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a son of it.
Within three years.
It was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  And so slid in the room and was impressed as a mom leg with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be topics of courage and resilience and <unk>
I should have a sense that Luke one of the Army to remove government?
This with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do he win Dorothy her movie?
They are doing good <unk> with all of them and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with -- OK? And not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why are there so much force in lower capital -- force in the movies for our children, and so little on the road to <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that I would have served to navigate the world of the adults who are <unk>   I think at the moment of the first kiss actually expected them to appear because it is the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat villain, and getting your reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be an amateur animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, to defend the Disney princess to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, boys, are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend their <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't leave being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues up in classic after classic after classic <unk> or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
Until a lot of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good -- don't let that <unk>
Well, almost no one of these films is the proof of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't been absorbed and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a conversation about the <unk> of the movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> In the film, there is more than an female character than you have lines?
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women talk about each other in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than you like it?  OK? Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women that exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus that is a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> does not test the Turing test.
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go into bed <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we went through the numbers.
In 2011, in 2011, the most popular movies, how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually sexually once in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for kids have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music videos or pornography are closely linked -- but when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is there is a lot of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat happiness with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very disturbing statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to say, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our kids to keep their ability to keep their power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily by parents.
I think we need to show our males a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically radically changing.
You will have read about how new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite Star Star <unk> Do you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress itself.
I think they are experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than nobody, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us get their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories to tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where it looks like her work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and better to be better people, like the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked was to look at the coast of Maine at the coast of Maine because my parents told me that that would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was given to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized to see my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown to one of almost 1.3 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we can use <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern harbor of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, the simple eye seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using <unk> suddenly the place looks like pink pink
What you're seeing are the actual chemicals of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old American city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place stands in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of ancient art and architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge measures about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, it was moved to this and covered all the city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'm going to try and find random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball gloves on it.
So, we use NASA data to make a place of the place, very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the scientists Egyptians doing <unk> jobs you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it shows it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for human occupation we look for human occupation for human <unk>
Five feet down, underneath a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> layer of the <unk> of several hundred years that date from the Middle Empire, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs, quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk>
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common rocks in the jewelry, of the Middle Empire, these are the stones that <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that go back to the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry shop which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still haven't found <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire, probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to the TED is not founded in 1984 to give up C.
Do the ideas actually start in 1984 B.C. <unk> in a lost town not for a long time and found out from the top.
It certainly puts your own credit search in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside the door to <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a career management career and go address at their front doorstep.
I need you to see this <unk>
They are <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're going to jump too much.
They collide against the door of your house.
There is bicycles flying around and the wheels that go on the side of the wheels that end up in the front of the wheels that end up in the front of the door, put the threshold of the door.
To the lobby, to the hall, or what happens to the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse ...
It's a horse that speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> by raising your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you get to go into the mouth.
They walked on one side and enter your living room.
In the room, and I use most of his imagination, just imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing over his middle <unk> and singing <unk> -- One More <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The ground has been covered with a yellow brick path, and from the oven they come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, <unk> to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that has done every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different ages of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers -- <unk> just once.
We have the names of tens of strangers.
We took entire poems in just minutes.
They would be able to see who he could memorize <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be a phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man called Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
I actually have an average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition says they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using a few old techniques invented a thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that academics <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, "How did I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and bright, <unk> though a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist, <unk>
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order in a rubber deck -- in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start with something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year not just training my memory, but also trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a <unk> problem.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And it comes back, a lot of treaties on the memory of writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in the <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having the memory of <unk> <unk> <unk> and electronics -- it wasn't such a rare thing that you might like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they've also changed.
They've changed <unk> and I would say that they have also changed the cognitive world.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of <unk> memory and <unk> is this unique competence of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> it's like this all around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that it has brains in some ways or structural or different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're even smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually no.
But there was really interesting and significant difference between brains of memory champions and the subjects of control that the <unk>
When they put them into an MRI machine, you will look at your brains as they look at the numbers, the faces and forms of snow -- they found that in memory champions in the brain, different parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed to be a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive tournament is driven as an arms race where each year comes up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory memory.
In his desk, versus him, there's 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> <unk>
Within half an hour.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used to the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> says this: I'm going to say two people who remember the same word -- I'm telling you to you, you know, there's a man called <unk>
That's their <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you to think about that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> what <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his work is <unk>
Same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship.
with all the other memories dancing by their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk>
They have <unk>
They were fine when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when I first came out, that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this back two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
History says this: I had a poet called <unk> who was attending a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because he wanted to give a very good party, he didn't get to a <unk> he would get a poet.
He stood up <unk> his memory poem, and he <unk> and as soon as it was, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> all of us.
But not only killed them all of us, but it shattered the bodies to <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So you couldn't afford the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, he could see where he had been sitting every day.
I took the family of the hand of the hand of hand, and they were their loved ones on the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or telephone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If I was telling you that I was telling you that the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> it's very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet if you would tell you who was sitting on the horse and brown <unk> in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember -- the crazy thing to remember -- the crazy thing to do, the more the image, the more it will be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory memory of <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you guys have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, the same way that I would have done it <unk> if they were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of crazy image and crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote -- <unk> that you want to count.
And then it comes in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
So it's like <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word by word, which is going to confuse it's typical for typical.
In fact the <unk> term comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first would be like the first place in its memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event.
Really, it is serious, like seeing a lot of people sitting taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes all over the room before sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was fun.
I would never have expected you to get it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's actually about doing is better and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images, there are <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and some carefully <unk> covered only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a <unk> of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that you could go into a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be a good job for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers -- but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palazzo of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
They put a kind of deep processing -- a kind of profound attention that most of the people are not going to lie there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today is what the <unk> <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, let me leave me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our short existence in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side to our side -- we're so <unk> that we didn't even be able to process in terms of processing <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so let's just go through just a <unk> place New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from N. Jersey, I was six years old and lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my dorm room, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there you all spent the time looking at the television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me and every time I would sit down, and I would come up on a piece of papers, you all see me.
And I was like this.
It was hurt and I hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
<unk>
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and it's not a divide of areas -- but of those emotional connections that we feel in the places that we get.
And it's no wonder that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under their roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture will determine us in ways we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you ask you, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it as well as based on a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> using the architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we built our buildings.
It's an emotional <unk> connection, we've used this trick for a very, very long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, solid front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Public <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this round thing, columns, red brick -- that they leave <unk> which is about communicating with this <unk> children, the values of ownership, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet and to share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly carrying new technologies, new solutions for the life forms of life today.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so far away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead in the way we don't have another choice.
We have to go to the other side and go back with those <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we really feel like <unk> So we started to experience the back of the back on the back and over again and over again, we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago <unk> in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with called the <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk> scale.
Something really really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
I put the one back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we made them <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes would be <unk> they won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own fantasies <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian <unk>
Maybe with an infinite lot of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, it's cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we build memories of other places.
I know very well, and you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
architects feel frustrated and we started doing swing the one again in the other direction.
In the '80s and in the early '90s, we started to experience with the <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new <unk> design techniques -- and we found ourselves new <unk> a few ways that would be used against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare times when critical academics and public and public and public, they agreed on a building.
The New York Times newspaper.
The tourism in Bilbao increased a 2,500 percent when the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and radical forms, how is it possible to become ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because the media went around them, and we quickly learned that these forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They did the same mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennium, with other star.
She went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to go with all architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next village to see a building.
<unk> can be <unk> you can take a plane, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see on the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It's not quite accurate to think of a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before we know if the fact that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback on architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to be <unk> because we are on the biggest threshold revolution in architecture since invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media of communication, it starts swing more and faster, to get to be on both extremes -- almost in <unk> and the difference is effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you guys are the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that I ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that is <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community -- and as the drawings looked exactly at the end, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That early summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images from a building, are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your history, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with our collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was constructed today, first of the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use <unk> words, and sort of complicated, and you have no longer a <unk> public not accepts something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen and you don't get confused by architecture.
That means that the <unk> of a style of a <unk> movement is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
That means that a stadium in Brooklyn, it can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what it has to be a <unk>
That means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that the buildings will become <unk> to the whims of nature and not the other way.
That means a garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, Florida, can also serve to make sport or to <unk> or even one can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream <unk> in the East East <unk> and raise half a million dollars of the community connected around that cause, it's not a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite places.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of them.
Buildings are not just reflecting our society, but they give it way to the most <unk> spaces -- local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he already started walking.
And it does this great typical way of the kids of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look for the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
She <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it, and I was thinking, "When did I stop doing this?
How is it that we are not comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I am <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager he wants to be loved and in.
He's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, even though his mom says all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Between what his mom says and what his friends, or colleagues in school said, doesn't know who you believe.
So a video of it is making a video of it, he publishes it on YouTube, and he begs others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager that receives these answers in one of the stages of their most emotionally emotionally.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it getting to do this?
Well, adolescents today are almost not alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We've never been so connected, in a continuous way, so young as young people.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, and it's always connected to our kids to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no divide between living online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what's rigged <unk>
What is the most powerful thing in the life of someone in front of somebody who is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> zero continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And <unk> like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture.
It's not hard to see what the young person compares to.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of the superheroes of the sport, and the singers will go.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and effort effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like your relationships, the development of their physical capabilities, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls would prefer to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They're fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and as a country's working development field.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One of five are not <unk> at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of exams, if you don't think you're good enough, specifically, if you don't think you're kind of thin, you get a note less than the average note of your fellow who don't care about it from appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland United States and China, in China.
And it gives regardless of what these young people weigh in.
So, in order to stay clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you are.
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers who are working with their little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they are <unk> they don't understand that they can take them into a waste food.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily ruled by the people around them and are in most risk of depression.
And we think it's all about all of this as they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diets <unk> aesthetics, sexual relationships in the early ages and without protection and harm damage.
The perfect body search is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women believe that they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in one day that they don't feel safe with how you see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which is that <unk>
We get this potential to be interested in each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes -- the first is that we have to nurture trust in their own body.
We have to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-worth.
The good news is that there are many programs that are available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that many <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are not just going to have a positive impact but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas -- the first is influence from family, friends and relationships.
These six things are crucial points for anyone willing to provide a education sense education that works.
One is a fundamental education, but to address this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the subject and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the status status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell you the contribution from our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of the <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not as you see them.
We can all start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow all their own person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be aware of the people who are, or to reach out what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who is in mind?
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
It might just be the woman who's at two car seats -- what would it mean for her whether he was released from that <unk> voice in her interior, that he would tell him about not having a long legs, even more <unk> -- a lower belly -- <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would make it free of their potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is coming back to us all.
But we encouraged our kids to the truth.
You know, the way you see it is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They were self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And to work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year age today will become safe agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five November November from the 1990s, named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the <unk> <unk>
By <unk> initially they would be able to be able to be able to be able to be an innocent charges in the company of others, they started planning attacks on about 12 icons of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans will be <unk> by an informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the spread of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't <unk>
Later on, it would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving mother, American mother, the two did all possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My dad taught me a form of Islam that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to <unk> it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all religion, all of the human group, there is always a little fraction of the people who were going to be able to be able to spread their convictions that they think you need to use all of the possible means that everyone lived like them.
A few months before arrest him, he sat down with me and explained that in the last weekends he and explained that in the last weekends, he had been going to pick up in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, it was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father -- my father helped me support the <unk> on the shoulder and explained how to point to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot I gave the little orange light on the goal, and to surprise you, especially mine, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a son.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what it was so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be committed to put up with 700 kilos of explosives in the underwater parking lot in the North Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability of my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was now time to pack and go to another city.
As long as I was always the new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white one, but it will be the new of the class, silent and <unk> age.
So most of the time I was going on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not develop social skills, to be able to say <unk> -- to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> I would judge people, based on <unk> <unk> like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think, was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program that I was involved in the National <unk> <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence -- as I had been victim of <unk> almost my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found out that one of the kids who we had done, friendship, was Jewish for.
I took several days out of the light that detail and realized there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud of having been able to defeat the barrier that all of life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment arose when I got a summer work in "The Bush <unk>
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures, that experience turned out to the development of my character.
All of life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay men were bad <unk>
By the case, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering from others. But it was not easy for me to treat people kind of exactly the way I wish to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what it is to be on trial for something beyond my control.
Then he came along, <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be honest with my <unk> and I helped him see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a moment that I was desperately <unk>
On times, the inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not any avail.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how my mother was changing my way to think, and she told me something that I keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside of you.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship to my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done this because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to lead the violence, you can hear my story and understand that there's a better path. That even though I would give me this ideology to violent and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and by their loved ones, and the loss that the terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of the terror, to speak against those acts of <unk> like <unk> to my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put up here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the roads in their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that is projected in your minds.
It's an incredible <unk>
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and look right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, meaning and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like the time of your childhood you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in straightforward.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each one of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie and you and you and you.
There is nothing to be more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of your own.
I have no certainty you have to be aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we are not aware of anything in our lives it would have sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why are we not just robots that are going to be able to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
And so that to integrate awareness to the science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Science is an objective for nature.
<unk> for nature, is subjective stuff.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for nearly the 20th century, we will get that vision.
The psychology was studying behavior -- the neuroscience behavior -- the neuroscience is <unk> but never one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science, <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the science work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this guy in the fantastic work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not an evolutionary science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience is answering some questions that we want you to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to <unk>
It's actually not easy problems with consciousness.
So don't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why is that all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is it an internal <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> and we'll find an explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do we use them, how do you work <unk> how do you adapt and adapt to living organisms.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as a phenomenon <unk> how we talk about, how we talk about, how we play <unk> all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all of behavior is accompanied by an out-of-body experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have to say.
I'm a materialistic teacher.
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it works for for a long time, my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms, which would work.
But at the end of the end, I got to conclude that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to get ourselves at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations great. We got accustomed to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology accounts for psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea into our scientific vision of the world.
I think the consciousness, right now is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our vision of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> <unk> before dealing with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
Your crazy idea is that there's no such hard problem for consciousness.
All the idea of the inner subjective movie includes a species of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the mundane functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and this is study everything that needs an explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of quantum <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as a <unk> building space, the space and the mass.
<unk> laws of fundamental laws that are known as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and properties don't explain in terms of the most basic terms.
Instead, you consider them fundamental principles, and that's where the world is built.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- time dough, mass laws -- then I applied the basic laws of the <unk> and I applied the electric burden of electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation where we find consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time dough, you load it up, then for logic, we have to add that list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
That doesn't mean that it's not a sense of science.
It opens up the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness, the laws with other fundamental concepts -- space -- time, the dough, the physical processes.
<unk> sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we can do it in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can do it in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, <unk> by all of the system is conscious -- not just humans, the dogs, the mice, the mice, the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or that photons to them.
It's not that a <unk> can be full of anguish when you think about God, I always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But the thinking is that maybe photons can have any element of crude feeling -- <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How did anyone think about something so <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and dough, time and dough, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that restore thinking with physical process, is <unk> awareness with information.
Whenever there is information, there's always awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> from simple, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which is the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to be seeing with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of information, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a level of information integration of information, as significant as significant degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to these worms, microbes, microbes, the level of the <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of a different from zero.
It actually creates a fundamental law of <unk> high <unk> <unk>
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
You know, the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but don't talk about the reality that underlies underneath.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be used as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision is, I think, <unk> vision, has the potential to solve our relationship with nature, and it can have a very serious social and ethical implications.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think that it tends to do well, this tends to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms, and moral terms, is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its complexity and complexity.
It's also natural about consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has an complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are very serious about serious ethical problems about the development of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for consciousness of collective collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group as the audience at a TED Talk, we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal movie for this whole TED group, different from the inner movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
Actually, I'm really sure the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that from the second, which is universal.
<unk> raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how are those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will finally be able to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village all Victoria.
It had a very normal profile, a low education.
I went to school, I joined my friends with my friends, I was scared with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take a community of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there is one problem.
She hasn't actually gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series, the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, yes. How contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered an achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching up in a high school of <unk> so only after 20 minutes in the middle class, so just after 20 minutes -- a guy lifted his hand and said, "Hey, when do you get your <unk>
I said, "What is it?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in <unk> they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this boy had had a experience with people with disability as an inspiration.
And we don't know, and it's not the <unk> of the boy, which is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire them.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and probably you're waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to be <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lying in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital per <unk>
It's something bad and living with an disability, makes you remarkable.
It's not something bad and you can't make you <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more that lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad deal.
Or this <unk> "Your <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl without the hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber fiber.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which is what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the porn term <unk> because we would <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we <unk> the disabled people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been talking about strange <unk> to express that you believe that I'm brave or an inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like if I was going to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These pictures, these images are attached to people with disability to benefit from people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's get some things.
But the things that we ran out of aren't the things you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was focusing on the so-called social model of disability that tells us that we are more disability because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned to pull out the best of their ability as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking out the best of their ability.
So, it's actually just <unk> in the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, it doesn't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I am here -- the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by something else.
And actually, I know I am.
People who have disabled people all over time.
But I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use a little bit of <unk> to pick up the things that you fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to load the battery from the phone phone on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resilience from others, not against our bodies and <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that has been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad thing; the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles at a stretch of stairs hasn't made it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a TV screen will not come up with the <unk> <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all of those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to actually live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low enough of the people with disability that we are <unk> to get up from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the true achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a boy of 11 grade school in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think is doing it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to respond to one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people actually think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality that <unk>
The first step, is what I wear -- Google Google Glass.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you <unk> with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the playing field of <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> trying to <unk> it with all of his being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
I would take some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> <unk> is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
You know, a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know.
The Rift Bank has been described as the most realistic virtual reality ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, four.
No, no, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a rollercoaster in a rollercoaster held by his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan when I took a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before he run and made a <unk> which will be the experience of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball into the back of the network?  Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What will be your experience when you take away from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour -- like a <unk>
Maybe they get rid of your diapers <unk>
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we actually get the reality of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality, augmented reality when I encourage them, and the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a short refresher on the technology <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios in the <unk> of the field <unk> and then after the defenses.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player going back to your group and you see your next thing to be shown in front of you, in a plastic array that they carry on. You don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They only go out to the field and react.
And the coaches want to be because if you don't keep their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose matches you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your party <unk>
How do you look like?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all of that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know about it.
The bad news <unk>
This is going to get good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being alone.
It will also be <unk> who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
You put the ball and <unk>
<unk> to an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight will be told that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you normally don't know it, but the <unk> system is <unk>
It took the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there's an open receiver
<unk> the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in their Norden bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
He <unk> grabs the <unk> running and <unk>
The <unk> public and the fans have followed by each angle.
This is something that makes a massive emotion on the game.
So I'm going to make you lots of people, you see, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it only as bread and <unk> as our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth of <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how is your actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology to a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is that for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation generation to think more about space and science rather than <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we face and the challenges we face -- as a forever, of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years in the country was <unk> the south end of County County -- which includes the <unk> bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful <unk> <unk> -- the Pacific Ocean and its inspirational <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, as one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an master master engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical nor <unk>
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that travel between the two dimension, this bridge has become another dimension, so that the fall of it frees you out of all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a drop of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
And the impact is breaking down the bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of them die on the impact.
The ones that don't normally fall in the water <unk> and then <unk>
I don't think that the suicide method will become aware of the death of the death of the death of <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel in the bridge.
This is where most people are going to have before they get their lives.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest time, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to an official looking at her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had successful that day in bringing it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
They were able to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> the suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him 22 <unk> last year when he got a call from a possible subject bomber sitting on the cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with an officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it was flown up to two times before from New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the box <unk>
<unk> mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came up with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open up the box and there's no <unk>
She stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This nice, smart boy in New Jersey had just had a living.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
<unk> damage attacks affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it <unk>
What do you get?
What does it mean?
In my experience, you don't just talk about, but you need to hear.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about how their life, have had these <unk>
They would encourage the person in front of their life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be able to believe -- to believe that there's nothing that you can do to <unk> social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on January 19 in January this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with her license and blessing that the <unk>
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience of being there.
I'm thinking I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking to your friends talking to your friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but seeing more moments of realizing that Mike won't come home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the shot of 49 with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
I witnessed this, I had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental disease.
It must not be that easy to finish with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> Bridge Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to get out.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, <unk> a radio call for a possible subject on the sidewalk sidewalk near the northern tower.
I took my motorcycle off the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> feet on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, they immediately cross the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the next and the next one, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
And Kevin decided for his mind that day back to that lane and giving life another chance.
When Kevin came back, he <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did that <unk> and you gave the hope and the life was <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, <unk> <unk>
You stopped me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother from Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to give it to me.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of <unk> and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I took Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
I took debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> <unk> When I visited General St. San Francisco at night, you would be able to be the patient.
I know I had to do it.
Currently, Kevin is an active father and an active member of the society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with hope that his story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, innovation opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they would not think to hurt another person.
They just want your own pain.
Usually this is only about three things: sleep, or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and called suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in, but these two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I would get her hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those guys who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the second one that they leave the railing realized they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us should be able to be able to do it.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you guys to be what you are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question comes to you, how do you become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model, I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that had had since a child.
My outside my outside was finally <unk> with my inner truth.
So for complicated reasons, when I look at this picture later, when I look at this picture, you got there, you got it up, you get it up, you get it up, you know, <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that <unk> I'm getting started.
We all overestimate our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations imposed on the color of the skin or for the beliefs that surround us.
They're people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years old, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I recorded like <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, at my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt in my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's more complex and mystery here.
Because of my success, I never gave myself to share my story, not because I thought that being bad, but how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
All days to be a woman.
I have mom, my dad and my family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a goddess goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something else, I was <unk> This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever done in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was going to be responsible for the costs of <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won in the bathroom, he won in <unk> and she got third <unk> between over 40 months.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was in the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was of queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. who had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that I would have my request from the green card that I could live to live in the United States.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, like traveling and being a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I would put two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied me in Thailand at the age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most expensive surgeries sophisticated and secure.
In the United States, it was necessary to get the surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears was <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> lived his truth, but that <unk> actually put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we make a global vigil by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood up against injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 <unk>
My most profound truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you --  -- thank you --                                                          
<unk> <unk> Sure. First of all, thank you for all my <unk>
My network of support, my parents especially, to my family, who is actually very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who I've been doing, and sometimes when I called me and told me that their parents couldn't embrace it, I took my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked out. It's just gender identity -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us assigned a gender to birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes that task is not block, and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
I should have room for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very kind. Thank you.
In many tribal societies and tribal parents generally know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who knows about his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in the 2007. And when her efforts were <unk> her efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National Prize stopped peace, it became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his dad.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of <unk> of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when at birth a girl, her birth didn't be <unk>
It's not welcome, nor for your father, nor for your mother.
The neighborhood comes, he gives her <unk> to the mother and no one to the father.
And a mother became a lot of a little bit for having a child.
When you give birth to the first girl, the first daughter, gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a child, when he was born, his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the mother <unk> but the daughter. The daughter just <unk> when it grows, suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and school will admits their siblings.
Until the age of 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when she was 13 years old, you refuse to leave her house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that honor, they could even kill.
And it's interesting that this idea of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
I'm supposed to be a good girl must be very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of your father and your mother decisions and even if you don't will.
If you call it with a man who doesn't like or if he <unk> it with an old man -- he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more kids and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at her eyes, believe me, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter for her.
But when I stopped, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I grabbed my <unk> and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old, I was going to go back to my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yeah, I should <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies -- is a great event for a young life.
It means a school recognition of his identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore its potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they went to <unk> Canadian and I was in the relative part of the family, couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters in any document.
That was the reason why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for <unk>
I took my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught them to the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, pushed for more rights for women, and they were terrified to have more and more room for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped the markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and stood up with the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, the BBC, was offered to be for the New York Times and talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the nine October 2012, was shot by <unk> in his head.
It was a day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he took him to the ear of my wife -- "I must <unk> what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't get you."
<unk> the fair cause.
It will take your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't get asked again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> on the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm good with my smile, and with my face.
I'm going to make it good. Please not be <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters have learned from her how to resist in the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite the women's rights icon and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
And he <unk> when he didn't end up with it.
They fight her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special about my instruction that has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut out his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google Google group, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation, you get to <unk>
You are still like smart or not?
Doesn't be like that, you can be intelligent again.
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals and try to adapt to live alive.
More than I've been saved by little.
But fortunately, I have a <unk> soul, so I decided that I was going to be able to get the dose to try and get the dose, that there really doesn't exist in <unk>
I began to try and try and mix up different <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small in the doses changed in the dose dramatically changed my <unk> my sense of who I, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried doses and different chemical doses for a man of <unk> and I was surprised to see how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several types like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out to be a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was actually making a little bit of it, and fixing a problem with the front, and it just didn't happen like that.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do, since then I get better with men.
So what I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
And I think almost always in pictures, and that became my key reference point -- how do I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> looked at similar ways.
They thought that images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
There are people who challenge this idea, and there are lots of arguments about how the brain works, for me is very simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I get to find the point right and have a lot of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated mental <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to lead these mental images of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use his imagination just to steer the world that has the way?
Or if a musician <unk> could get the music of his head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to get this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that made out of two recent experiments done in neuroscience.
Both of them both used MRI technology -- image MRI.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person looking at an image.
The middle column shows the brain scanning of the brain that same individual as you were looking at seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the core of the central column on the left. It looks that the difference is near <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab by Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube while <unk> their brains to create a great pool of brain reactions to the video sequences.
Then they showed you a movie with new images -- new people, new animals, and as much as a new <unk>
The computer -- using just the brain information <unk> to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're good at doing that.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same image, it believed in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning systems of information and available today, and its resolution has been increased as a thousand times in the past years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we achieve that?
There's a lot of techniques to do it.
One is open up the skull and you get electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many of you are proposing new techniques of projection by images, even I am, with the recent result of the MRI -- we have to ask, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but to this point, more <unk> magnets only offer small improvements in the resolution that doesn't have increased by thousands of them.
I propose this idea: Instead of larger magnets make better magnets.
We can create a much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in the MRI went to make really big, right?
However, the majority of the recent developments in <unk> and brilliant solutions and shining <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the radios and frequency receptors in the MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field, <unk> magnetic patterns <unk> <unk> to the radio frequencies <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio processing processing of <unk> radio processing -- we can increase in massive shape the information that can be taken into one <unk>
Also, we can then divide into layers of our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands of them.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid -- but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even neural activity direct that is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in a direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could pass above language and communicate directly through <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have little choices to open this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it takes a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay knot.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet maybe say to some person for the first time that he loves him or telling someone who's pregnant, or to tell someone who's pregnant, or to tell someone who has cancer, or any difficult conversation that you have ever entered in life.
All I'm going to think is a hard conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave me <unk> as a <unk>
And I'll be slope from the <unk> of my short pants and so I had <unk> my head by doing little, I would usually ask a child to say, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And it would look uncomfortable at the table.
<unk> my jaw a bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father was <unk> the newspaper and the mother would sing a cold look at his son.
But I would say anything, and I went into it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised you that next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
It's a family silence, but this time I was prepared and was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues" that <unk>
So I took a breath back, and I went down and my backs -- a four year-old girl with a pink dress dress staring at what is not a challenge for a feminist, <unk> one girl with a question: "You're a boy or <unk>
And so I took a breath back, again, I got <unk> about it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw her clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, I'm a girl, and you know, you like to use a rose dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Anyway, I'm more of the kind of girl of a fellow <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all the <unk>
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the hard <unk> conversation ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color is walls.
You just know how one feels like a <unk>
That's how my universe is not different from yours or yours or yours.
They will give you 100 reasons about why to get out of my closet it was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared to <unk> <unk> is harder to tell that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is more difficult to tell your five-year-old year-old who is going to <unk>
There is no more difficult thing, there is only the hard thing.
We must stop to classify what is hard to make us feel better about how difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we should just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make safety or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail -- a dress and dress shoes.
It was not a militant lesbian prepared to fight any child in four to go in the coffee.
I was frozen in a corner of my dark closet in a corner of my dark closet -- my gay, and the moving only one muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, all of my friends, full strangers that I've spent my whole life trying to <unk> and now the world would turn back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many girls knew that I was gay, and when I was doing my <unk> <unk> and <unk> black dress around the tables and finally came to one where my friends were friends in my parents, people who knew me for years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women were <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
The gay story had begun.
<unk> you ever were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good -- and it's never talked about having <unk>
<unk> which is your TV program.
Our <unk> <unk> Will Grace go?
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but trying to show desperately how to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses cowboy shirt.
And I had an opportunity at that time, like you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to tell where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you will be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
That's how the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have ever met.
But I'm getting better, and I continue to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what is going to be out of any closet that's essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be true.
<unk> armor. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> everybody else needs to know that they also <unk>
Number two: Be straight right -- <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, you go.
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and most important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be used for that.
And some of them can be injured safe in which they have done, but never I'm sorry about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some you feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you get into a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the history of how the intelligence has seen -- an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> did this as a critical <unk> of computing like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we would bring a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take a walk.
Let's start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you are from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or intelligence on Earth or intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can observe the Earth, and they have incredibly large life, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know the reason it would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth -- it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until some time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I studied a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying underlying intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be spiraling out for the development of intelligence, and, in particular, to develop the development of the future diversity of future diversity.
Finally, in the <unk> movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have been trying to harness the robots abilities to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different themes and <unk> together, I said, from a number of years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of an E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an claim that intelligence is a force -- F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action or keeping the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of potential potential accessible, but to an impending imminent future, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the options open.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human <unk>
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection is <unk> <unk> between the entropy and intelligence has a more controversial relationship.
What if smart behavior is not just correlated with the production of entropy in the long run, but it actually arises from her?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system where you can find it inside.
Surprisingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal intelligence testing playing human intelligence, play games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of that without being told to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided for his balance <unk>
This ability to be applications will have applications for running robotics and human assistance.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite sides of a string at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of that task model.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against themselves, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where friends are constantly becoming <unk> and keeps with successful <unk>
This same web capacity also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the lanes of a fleet of ships, discovering successful success and using the Panama Canal to extend globally from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiation and successfully actions, the assets under its exponential management.
This ability of risk management will have vast applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of smart cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation. They all flow from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep irony.
So let's go back to the beginning of the <unk> <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we were able to make smart machines, there would be a legitimate rebellion, there would be <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion, <unk> into reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all other things that the urge to take control of all the future possible is a most fundamental principle than the intelligence, general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control, instead of being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, the following: intelligence has to be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the elixir of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
In the last few years, we've extended a tremendous amount of our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points the Earth is just one among the billions of planets from our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope on the space of the faint light intensity when the planets go through them, and they block a little bit of that light that goes up.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their mother.
Together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small, <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their suns.
At the time, it gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure. of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
And these environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale has <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not any scientist at climate, and I am no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, most of our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the very early planet and the planets that we know better: better from our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world, this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past, and partly that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracks their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission will take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But despite the fact that all of these images, we will remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas that are linked in our imagination with the Earth, and we compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain in <unk> places that are really matched compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places of the Earth and the air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests and thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement of the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag with a big and sad challenge that implication, and the belief of some that Mars will wait for us to save this <unk> <unk> from the only planet to know that it's truly <unk> the Earth.
For a lot that I like exploration -- I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are many good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be able to preserve humanity is as imagine that the captain of the Titanic would tell us that the captain of the truth will have place later in the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration, and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces, in the hostile areas of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi once said, having in account our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life to now.
Okay, where are you?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox per solution is that when civilizations become advanced enough in order to consider to live among the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that are going to build this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization <unk> will save us from ourselves, but <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to compare the hostile environments of Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the easier task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, <unk> my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized he didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see by the window that they were on the dining table, where he had <unk> them.
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and all of them were very closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it up, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff <unk> to spend night, because I had an early flight to the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but they are sure not more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of the night, so I thought, despite the circumstances of the living room.
I'm a career of profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> increases your heart rate -- <unk> the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the <unk> of <unk> in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do -- systems that would put in place, that I would put it up to the bad things.
Or at least, if bad things happen, the likelihood of a total catastrophe will be.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't understand.
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him about that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me that I'd been practicing something called retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as you can look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, then he tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the shape of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
On the house, we <unk> a place for things that are very upset.
This sounds common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fine, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the tribes live, where tribes live, and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that enables you to find their nuts.
And if you wonder if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and still they could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car, <unk> <unk>
So at home, you go home -- a place for the keys, a hook along the door, maybe a plate <unk>
To your <unk> a specific <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it their stuff always will be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a photo card, a picture of your credit card, driver's card, <unk> <unk> by email themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems into the site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved self to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all making medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, whatever decision you need to take from that would benefit a rational evaluation of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have gotten the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack the heart of brain.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about <unk> and he knows it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even likely you know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you must ask for most doctors don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number we need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who should take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And you must think about what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the blame of the doctor, and if you blame somebody, it's the scientists like me.
We have not understood the mechanisms of it.
But the estimated estimates that 90 percent of the drugs just works only from 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number we need to treat <unk> more widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help one person?
300.
This is according to the research of the <unk> researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I mean, the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance on 300 of my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> of the effects, Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And these include things that include painful pain -- <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The Five percent is not very likely to go to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you get this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 of them have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug that helps you help you.
I don't say you should or don't take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want the risks or not.
And you may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number we need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that more people do in the older men of 50, <unk> from prostate prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
That's 30 surgeries a person who has helped.
And the side effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky enough and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we will take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice a lot of times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can shift from opinion in the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get lunch for the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, like, <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to figure out how to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future of how those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help you minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I went to the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, and my contractor installed a combination of combination along with the door, with a key to the entry door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't heard of, and lots of email messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not very skeptical, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to be <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree, there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can ever be killed by a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the time, they mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true at all.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign world, following the rules, their rules, and <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do I understand that?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"I don't know the <unk>
"Don't make a lot of noise when you eat the potato <unk> bag.
"Not <unk> and when you are eating, make sure it wasn't <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag than the average person does it.
I'm a super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's coming next.
From there, this drawing.
Make sure alone?
<unk> to keep going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> subtle <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, doing my thumb with my thumb doesn't feel natural.
That's why I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> spaces -- and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend, and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to be more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experienced through the ears.
I can feel sorry or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all they had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and get it out.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the number of support and attention that I got.
And I realized that sound is like money, the power -- the social currency <unk>
On the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it might well be able to get to me and my artistic work, or it could be <unk>
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in work and institutions, I work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me to be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value -- something like taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If we're not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could <unk> in the <unk> and you don't have any social value.
So, with the sound like my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the world of the music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
Those two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the signals as well as the sounds.
I would like to share with you a piano metaphor so you understand how <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different <unk> parameters,
If you outsource a different parameter for each finger while you touch the piano, like the facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so while the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you get just a key button at a time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers <unk> to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If just a key key, the <unk> would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different <unk> parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal would be in that."
This is the <unk> signal in it."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign signal, the sun comes out and you put in.
This is all day."
If you put it up and <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All the day.
I feel that the same thing can be called <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how you express time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right hand, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through head and chest.
<unk> <unk> claw <unk> <unk> <unk> The <unk> E, claw <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
Everybody in high hands.
Now we're going to do it as much in my head like his chest, and just like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages from signs around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please raise again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest. But they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how <unk> live and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very small world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't automatically have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own <unk>
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And perhaps people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not to hear the music.
<unk> is a rich trove of treasure.
I would like to encourage you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can do everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults would lie to protect us from the awful truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning people's people.
Time country, now I'm adult and teach citizens and invention in New York City in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk on the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, I would encourage the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans are in plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, and collecting these pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also too expensive to use these huge boats
So along with my students, with six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny room in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work with <unk> so that kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I will tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools are really cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
And we collect the plastic and we reduce it the size we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That's what we do.
I let my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just to get information.
Through the use of a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the kids will become a lot of the robots.
Then we started to quickly create what we call "a <unk>
We are as fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned on light and web cameras and web cameras and <unk> in a floating robot that will move slowly out of the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see plastic pieces floating through the sensor while the computer on board process process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of how many plastic in the water.
I took this invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even further.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> they're trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to research my problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
Do you see the news, you look at the Internet, and they will get away with this <unk>
A kid, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill -- just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water gets <unk> where the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil is brown color and when all of the <unk> is very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be attached through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
So we had this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I can investigate a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that <unk> a number of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> crops on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power near water.
And today, according to the average reports of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the coast of the coast -- and the majority of the time, and the majority of the moment, is sure, is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and researching a independent way with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night we went to the center of the <unk> here you see the use of different masks?
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work -- but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> your whole life.
Together with them we discussed the data that's going on and we talk about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> we introduced <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to see that the radioactive dust, <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk> estimate estimate.
But based on this organized an civil expedition -- the closest nuclear power to date.
We get closer to 1.5 miles of nuclear power, and with the fishermen of the fishermen in the area we were collecting <unk> sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> of sediment as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of a small level, we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we converted it into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal and chemistry, a little bit of biology, is basically building almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of age, transforming their standard wheels on new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, scientists, we have to prepare the next generation to get care of the environment and people, and so it really can do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> two very opposite design cultures.
One is made out of thousands of steel pieces -- the other one silk thread the other.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is <unk> over the environment, the other thing we believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other by it.
Michelangelo <unk> he said when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of <unk>
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we took all the information for every cell to work and to go to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and production production.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think about their objects like <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material material in nature.
Think of the human skin for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are smaller with small <unk>
You act mostly as they planted the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that gradually moves its functionality through <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents twice as a view of the world and an architect of every designer of every designer and architect to work today between the <unk> and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and synthetic analysis is shown in both screens after me.
My work, in its simplest level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, Why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment -- where you can find four disciplines that offer access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please meet the minds and my students.
We are designing objects, products, structures and tools through <unk> scale, like this robotic arm with an scope of the diameter of the diameter of the diameter of the <unk> which is not very far to print <unk> buildings, and the nanoscale <unk> made that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture and has created a screen where every single opening is only size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> that was for a fashion fashion fashion with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with a 3D printing collaborator -- we print this layer and 3D skirt on the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and rigid materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and into the instruments of <unk> it allows to design products that are <unk> not only the way of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair as comfortable as comfortable as it also absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator came back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
His surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not through addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk>
But it's the <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck with and came to define a lot of what matters.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree, <unk>
For that first <unk> tree, there would be no difference between trunk, and there was no leaves and <unk>
All the tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made trees growing with twigs, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if objects made of a single part?
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we are looking for the material -- the kind of material of the tree of the tree, with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or <unk> or <unk>
We thought if we can tune into the <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  <unk> lots of husks of <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
We <unk> the chemical concentrations -- we have been able to achieve a broad range of <unk> from dark, tough, <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures -- it was built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one single three material -- 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, you dry it up to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process that were a <unk> process, which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> to mesh and if it broadens even more, on the window.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first life forms on the planet, with abundant water, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp <unk> in a architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best two: for objects designed for <unk> and put in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the floor, going to grow a tree.
<unk> for our next design principles, was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
So to do that, we have to master the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the chart <unk> we did our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just rather than <unk> metals -- new <unk> of biological <unk>
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is the <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that live in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and it produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution for design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract -- that will help you get these bacteria and to make them their function of the way.
So we started to grow these channels in the human body, <unk> the material properties according to the functionality of it.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, providing more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when it stretches out from one end to another, is 60 meters.
This is half of the length of a football field and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are past <unk> <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design is going to get the other <unk>
What if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> tissue harmed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this material stuff.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer will make stuff in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture in which a home is <unk>
The manufacturing is not going to evolve to this level of <unk>
It's done by combining two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, you put those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a structure, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of <unk> <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the worm <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we would <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape the composition, the <unk> structure of the <unk> <unk> directly through the environment.
They often get rid of silk worms to death in their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we managed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot by doing <unk> silk, and we put ourselves into our site.
We knew that silk worms are going to more dark and dark areas that we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat by spreading the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> worms to a online silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to be prepared with us.
We put it carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as you get older, they were going to be able to stick eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
At the top silk silk on spider silk, which is giving all this pavilion out of our integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, you know, silk worms <unk> <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through an <unk> arm, full plastic <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us to form a two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired in nature as a nature inspired by design, which demands us, for the first time, that we do charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they were asked for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be <unk>
It's caused by some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and the arts and the web was playing the guitar in a punk called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to try and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, it's not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I transferred to something else, something totally different, and I'm going to focus on it, and I'm going to let me absorb -- and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions and give them to <unk>
Another reason I made so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something bad about me for not <unk> at all.
I was concerned with engagement, or to be dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to ask you then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I will tell you where we did, they learned from culture.
You ask ourselves first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were doing at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in kids like, to be <unk> or to be <unk> or to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done again and again as we grow in different ways, you have a lot of high school students, you ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of being the cute <unk>
Why?
If this question inspired kids to dream with what might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything you might be.
In fact, it does just go on the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though they are good enough people who are going to be like, and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine converted into <unk> <unk> and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is really <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> of the idea that every one of us has something that you have to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and I will spend your life on it.
But if you're somebody who's not connected to this way?
What if there are many different themes that wake up your curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling bad with one.
There's nothing bad at you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so I say.
It could help if you divide into three parts: multiple <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
Do you know any term you like or <unk> yourself.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe <unk> you must beat.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there's huge strengths in the way that way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, traveling mathematics and design, to start <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates male jewelry.
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea only for its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
Out of the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all its background, you can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second superpower, <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> it <unk> we are <unk>
We are looking at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> by having been <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and getting out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are attached to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a child, who was an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it became a writer, <unk> was a ton of financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when he was starting their thumb, and this ability to write compelling launches for the editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to go to what you would ask you, even if you finally got it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge into a totally different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower chord is adaptability. It means the ability to transform into anything that you need in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, again, a website designer -- sometimes a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, as James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because they can take various <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Company Company as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, which actually <unk>
<unk> from ideas -- quickly learning and <unk> three abilities where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you might lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encourage the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems -- <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> <unk> knowing they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing bad at you.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep into depth and practice ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design and design lives that we are connected to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, in large <unk> they are going to be told to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said that, if there's one thing that you will take from this talk, I hope it's this: I think it is -- you know, <unk> with internal wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart of heart, then you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I said, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
Take the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads us to more authentic and happy.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately he passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> performed a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you were to have been living today, we couldn't give it more help than she <unk> it was <unk> years old.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's been made in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that by the way, including many of you.
If you wait to live until 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability of getting their years to spend their years or helping to take care of a friend or to be dear to Alzheimer's.
In fact, in the United States, Alzheimer's disease costs 200,000 dollars a billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spending in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its cost costs -- a five times increase in the year 2050, by 2050, as the generation generation is <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's relatively recently to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's research despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's disease and cause a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of all, the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the number of Alzheimer's patients to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory and memory skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's -- significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plate and <unk> <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For nearly a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these dots -- they end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are left on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University, trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the pump explode.
You have to find the right step that we did, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the cables have dropped the wires and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, the biologists, our chemicals, physicists, and engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen this yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that you stick with each other within them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see it <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive opening result: but research like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of waiting for <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to have a disease that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and that if we could, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists, and <unk>
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment at the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the gay victims of their loved day and night, they're often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients today, and they can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> speaking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I took this article into the New York Times in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone to do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when I test it myself as a summer of the past.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers <unk> to take 36 questions and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or your ability to would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you get to another person?
And <unk>
They <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> actually <unk> me to your partner what you like to do or her, and I know it was very honest about this time, and I gave up things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me about it, the gadget two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance of testing this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the Love column, and you know, a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, they are still still ready.
And the reason I think you challenge this is because you've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was published was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked me to write about my experience in romantic love.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually only from my Facebook friends and imagined that my paper in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that had a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But since they gave no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, the Sunday had already called the pyramids and Show and Good <unk> <unk>
Within a month, the paper received over eight million <unk> and I was, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing with TEDGlobal about their own <unk> experience, but another thing is to find out that creative life of one has been international news been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called <unk> or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, they did the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman yelled at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately started red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that both of us would make public emergence together.
I had television interviews, and he refused to refused two photos of us two.
I think I was afraid I was afraid of becoming the <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of which I didn't feel like at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study works, they wanted to know if the study works, so if it was able to produce <unk> love, not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, above all, that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you put together or not, and then <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal approach to graduate students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt closer after doing this, several studies, and they also used <unk> protocol -- as a quick way of creating confidence and interaction among strangers.
They have been used by members of the police and the community of the community. And they've used it in between people from opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I proved the past, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately he never got published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> for it.
I said, "Do you want to say that the person would get you to the person who <unk> it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, but it became better friends?
<unk> that they did get better and better after the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and it was going through a really difficult one.
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to almost all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I'm going to focus on science.
I did everything I could find on the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that I could kind of get the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I only did research for the book that I wrote, but in retrospect, it really seems to be <unk>
I thought that if I met with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and I used to feel like I sat then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what you get.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than reasonably than reasonably than to demand me.
What I'm looking for about love is a smell, not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> but to keep being <unk> indefinitely for the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the risk of the risk -- and this is a very scary story, because in love to fall in love to feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that asks, still follow together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, you know, ask them to ask questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship, even more, how you live in the doubt of your partner?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more thoughtful conversation about what to love somebody.
So, if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year, and we apply a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article -- the love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we take the choice of be.
And I <unk> a little bit by reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything I was supposed to do.
I didn't think that we would have both of them to make that decision, and how sometimes you will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and say, 36 questions, I have chosen to love somebody as generous, kind of fun and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done instead is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really think about.
And what I want, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end of implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he is also love, and is scary -- but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple of lesbian in full mountain, and in a way, I became like a forest <unk>
The city of New York City does a time.  One thing that really affected me but more detail later.
I'm going to start when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, and a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and figure out how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat the spaghetti.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and do <unk> and all of those things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to style. Martin, I covered the resin and a bee kept <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: in some way it seemed to rise size, like if it was that they would take the text with a <unk>
So I did. I built a more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, some strange little bottles that I was finding out on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw into space.
I can flow from drawing like you do about a <unk> in the crime scene.
And I took out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First, <unk> that you might have an idea.
Then I made insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I became interested in the human form of <unk> sculptures with drawings of human beings in the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass, similar to the drawing on a window, and then in another window and another window, and it had all of these windows together which formed a three-dimensional composition of them.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, which I call <unk>
To <unk> I was very inspired by "The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals in animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world from <unk> to this <unk> mesh <unk>
So here is where the creatures with animals are run by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird God tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the license of Osama Bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look at the ocean.
But also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand, while the other hand gets clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, you have a bird, like a bird, and it spits out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail of <unk> that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn into fire by <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends in a <unk> <unk> made out of terrorist cards in 1986.
They have <unk> them.
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from the terrorists.
Very <unk> at his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazine.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in the form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they come together, divides together.
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 kilos with a human being trapped inside the inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest is <unk> the entrance to you.
They are going to be diagnosed with the rest of the body -- there is a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or your penis or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a broken body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue coming in.
There is a little forest scene within <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, there's a physicist a neuroscientist, a painter, a writer, a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world -- and a garden.
And we put the box and all the people inside it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you get <unk> who is and the box where it is living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, of the <unk> of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so this pill actually has the effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug would be used in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any medication.
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs -- these serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart <unk>
But they are also known to their side side effects, in its most negative -- because in time that it takes to the current current <unk> it will be <unk> and worse for the time that it takes to its destiny, which is where most importantly, in the HIV tank,
These are regions of the body -- like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of <unk> life per se.
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the virus, no risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for wounds and wounds and diabetes surgery, they can be used for anything else to do, including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open or drill into extremely small holes, which open and closing almost immediately cells infected cells with HIV to introduce medicines.
And you better ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful beam beam on the mobile membrane of HIV and the cells that are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of <unk>
Before you even count, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro and <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a three head.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, go to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher in our case, a treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, not armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They do what these groups do when they're not shoot 'n.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage violent participation to the confrontation of violent <unk>
I do field work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be an <unk> <unk>
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between the states and actors.
For example, the <unk> arrangements for <unk> <unk> between 1975.
So we have to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do we do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, how do they do, but no one looks at what they do when they don't cooperate.
The United States struggle and political policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980, <unk> has also established a political game, a social services network and a military system.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups do more than just by shooting.
They're multitasking
They would take a complex machinery from <unk> stations, radio channels, web websites and social networking sites.
And here you have the printed magazine magazine in English and published in the <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising hedge fund but by using business companies for example.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to better recruit and build their brand.
Social groups are also doing something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, they put professional training programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state won't be safe and protection.
The ascent of Taliban in an Afghanistan held by war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for delivering security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services, means filling a vacuum, a gap <unk> by the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006, the Palestinian <unk> cannot understand the social work of the group.
It's a really complex setting, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid in them.
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps in the government, and they emerge like armed and political groups, participate in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated <unk> are these organizations, less we can do it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
And they were part of a territory -- running all of their function, and they collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, and we live in <unk> nations and hybrids and the most weak ones are states, like in the Middle East and the more <unk> and they fill that gap the actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in military tools.
<unk> that governance governance has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and strengthen peace.
If we understand the better groups -- we will understand how much incentives to encourage the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, the power of military power can win some <unk> but we don't give peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety of safety, to fill that governance vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I am a failure like a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to embrace the <unk> tag it would be <unk> for <unk>
I <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I would tell you about a bad feminist thing.
At least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger.
Let me step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and to get the sex. Like if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women treated all around the world and the anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that was using the people to the <unk> who might be a feminist feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a nice, nasty.
I would tell you as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's like or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that <unk> woman until you realize that it's actually that woman and it can't imagine being another person.
With time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also a proud of to be.
For me, certain claims are women equal to men.
<unk> the same paycheck for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as we would do it free of bullying or violence.
We have a right to use easy to use and accessible the contraceptives and the services <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing controls or doctrines of <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition and much more.
We have to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I am a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I listen to rap music -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and it offends women and it's deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of yin yang <unk> is incredible.
Does it actually come with your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical responsibility.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> garbage <unk> and the maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and good things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have fantasies about the fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my <unk> are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not a person who is <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, <unk> that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they were born.
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or deflected the needs of women of color, the gay and <unk> and <unk> for women, white, middle class and high <unk>
<unk> if that is a very bad feminist ...
It's also this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> into a <unk>
We expect it to make perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to get rid of that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of sector, are afraid to be tagged like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that tag means -- for fear not to be able to do with a little realistic expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist artist.
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show called <unk> to look at this star star openly and do to know women and young men who will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started endless debates if it was or not a feminist.
He <unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going much beyond reasonable criticism and constructive <unk> to <unk> feminism of any woman, <unk> until it does not remain anything.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or more <unk> feminism is <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little more brave.
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a supply product.
And these artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they make change effectively effectively their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does your music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify the worst choice.
But when bad decisions are justify that it makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
These are two girls and <unk> <unk> and brilliant, very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
And they were being told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, a sudden, the best choice will be used as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the movie in another part when movies do not treat women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their partners.
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, participate in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't get a number of women, so much to participate as much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also focus on to be even more like us to be able to be able to get to get the barriers to decision making.
We are not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without taking on these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the power of directors and movie producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create lasting and significant change.
We can also tell you with our feminism, -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be a <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, above all, because ancient my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident in front of what happened.
A few guys <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me like anything.
I started to believe it was nothing.
I mean, my voice, and after all I didn't bother to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I lie in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and the feminism, and I also discovered that if it was a little brave woman -- another woman could hear me and see that none of us is anything that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other hand, I get the undergraduate reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good feminist, I'm a good woman, trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope we can all be a bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had measles to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the amazing things about this outbreak is that measles that can be terrible for a child with a <unk> immune system, is one of the most likely diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the outbreak -- they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and the vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked by being an fraud.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still going to be able to get the vaccines into danger to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who had heard about her create their whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, estimates of prevalence continued stable as only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of hedge fund as <unk> <unk> is referred to autism as an epidemic as if I could get another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta and what is going on, they tend to be based on sentences like <unk> diagnostic and a better detection of <unk> to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language doesn't make a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his two years, the visual contact itself.
If the criteria of diagnosis, they had to <unk> why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progression of the science that with the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns <unk> Hospital Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 private companies, <unk> people around him, even to their own parents.
They could fun for hours by shaking their hands before their faces, but they were prey to <unk> by <unk> as when you didn't put their favorite toys in your usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as a main authority of the world in the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while they pick references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to children, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children sent out of other doctors to her office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have been kept in a refrigerator that we don't know.
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in the clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite studies, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the kids were just signing up, what they had heard their parents are desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Surprisingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started to prove the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive engineer in London, thought that the theory of mothers who was <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a profound autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as a black-eyed <unk> with no special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
In order to stand at the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
<unk> a research prevalence study in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic kids in the community.
What you saw was completely clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, into dinosaurs or <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful paintings and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realized these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the <unk> item and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article in the competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was translated it for her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school selling in Vienna in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children are <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music lessons with music, and kids follow their game games for the afternoon.
Rather than blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disabled disability of life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces.
Instead of dealing with kids in their clinic as patients, who called them their little teachers, and he started to help the development of education that were especially suited to them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of technology and disabilities.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, watching this continuous <unk> <unk> known as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> so the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and the early '90s, their changes were in <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by a wider and <unk> model.
These changes didn't fall into <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it was coming out, <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four prizes of <unk> <unk> psychologists, and parents around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first easy clinical trials to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> the same way that they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact hoped that it were, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the rise in the <unk> and a simple, powerful, <unk> history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, the autistic are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have come along on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that <unk> for the more <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with ability, communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we <unk> towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
